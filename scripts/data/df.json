Housing rents increase with housing demand with elasticities of 0.37 for non-slum housing and 0.07 for slum housing. Economic growth in cities thus causes slum growth because it attracts large number of low-income households who face higher rent growth for non-slum than slum housing. I further show that as economic growth improves households? incomes nationwide, an income effect reduces the national slum share. Finally, I find that two policy-relevant counterfactuals significantly increase ag-gregate income by relocating households into high-wage cities: 1) slum upgrading in high-wage cities 2) reducing the elasticity of non-slum housing rents to housing demand shocks.","funding":"CAF Development Bank of Latin America's research funds on Habitat and Urban Development in Latin America","cited":65,"publisher":"ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE","year":2021,"volume":"122","pages":15},{"authors":"Hartig, Jakob; Friesen, John; Pelz, Peter F.","title":"Spatial relations of slums: size of slum clusters","source":"2019 JOINT URBAN REMOTE SENSING EVENT (JURSE)","language":"English","doc":"Proceedings Paper","abstract":"More than half of the world's population currently lives in cities.

By relying on such inconsistent maps, it will be difficult to monitor the national slum upgrading program's progress. Remote sensing imagery combined with machine learning algorithms could support the reduction of these inconsistencies. This study evaluates the performance of two machine learning algorithms, i.e., support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF), for slum mapping in support of the slum mapping campaign in Bandung, Indonesia. Recognizing the complexity in differentiating slum and formal areas in Indonesia, the study used a combination of spectral, contextual, and morphological features. In addition, sequential feature selection (SFS) combined with the Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC) was used to select significant features for classifying slums. Overall, the highest accuracy (88.5%) was achieved by the SVM with SFS using contextual, morphological, and spectral features, which is higher than the estimated accuracy of the SBSM. To evaluate the potential of machine learning-based slum mapping (MLBSM) in support of slum upgrading programs, interviews were conducted with several local and national stakeholders. Results show that local acceptance for a remote sensing-based slum mapping approach varies among stakeholder groups. Therefore, a locally adapted framework is required to combine ground surveys with robust and consistent machine learning methods, for being able to deal with big data, and to allow the rapid extraction of consistent information on the dynamics of slums at a large scale.","funding":"Nuffic Neso Indonesia","cited":62,"publisher":"MDPI","year":2018,"volume":"10","issue":"10","pages":26},{"authors":"Ochako, Rhoune; Izugbara, Chimaraoke; Okal, Jerry; Askew, Ian; Temmerman, Marleen","title":"Contraceptive method choice among women in slum and non-slum communities in Nairobi, Kenya","source":"BMC WOMENS HEALTH","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"Background: Understanding women's contraceptive method choices is key to enhancing family planning services provision and programming. Currently however, very little research has addressed inter and intra-regional disparities II in women's contraceptive method choice. Using data from slum and non-slum contexts in Nairobi, Kenya, the current study investigates the prevalence of and factors associated with contraceptive method choice among women. Methods: Data were from a cross-sectional quantitative study conducted among a random sample of 1,873 women (aged 15-49 years) in two non-slum and two slum settlement areas in Nairobi, Kenya. The study locations were purposively sampled by virtue of being part of the Nairobi Urban Health and Demographic Surveillance System. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression were used to explore the association between the outcome variable, contraceptive method choice, and explanatory variables. Results: The prevalence of contraceptive method choice was relatively similar across slum and non-slum settlements. 34.3 % of women in slum communities and 28.1 % of women in non-slum communities reported using short-term methods. Slightly more women living in the non-slum settlements repotted use of long-term methods, 9.2 %, compared to 3.6 % in slum communities. Older women were less likely to use short-term methods than their younger counterparts but more likely to use long-term methods. Currently married women were more likely than never married women to use short-term and long-term methods. Compared to those with no children, women with three or more children were more likely to report using long term methods. Women working outside the home or those in formal employment also used modern methods of contraception more than those in self-employment or unemployed. Conclusion: Use of short-term and long-term methods is generally low among women living in slum and non-slum contexts in Nairobi. Investments in increasing women's access to various contraceptive options are urgently needed to help increase contraceptive prevalence rate. Thus, interventions that focus on more disadvantaged segments of the population will accelerate contraceptive uptake and improve maternal and child health in Kenya.","funding":"Consortium for Research on Unsafe Abortion in Africa; UK Department for International Development; STEP UP (Strengthening Evidence for Programming on Unintended Pregnancy) Research Programme Consortium; UK aid from the UK GovernmentCGIAR [SR1109D-6]; Sida; William and Flora Hewlett Foundation","cited":43,"publisher":"BMC","year":2016,"volume":"16","pages":13},{"authors":"Owusu, George; Agyei-Mensah, Samuel; Lund, Ragnhild","title":"Slums of hope and slums of despair: Mobility and livelihoods in Nima, Accra","source":"NORSK GEOGRAFISK TIDSSKRIFT-NORWEGIAN JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHY","language":"English","doc":"Article; Proceedings Paper","abstract":"Slums are universally assumed to be the worst places for people to live in, and it is often taken for granted that the livelihood situations of slum communities are also uniform and homogenous.

This review provides an overview of slum mapping-related remote sensing publications over the period of 2000-2015 regarding four dimensions: contextual factors, physical slum characteristics, data and requirements, and slum extraction methods. The review has shown the following results. First, our contextual knowledge on the diversity of slums across the globe is limited, and slum dynamics are not well captured. Second, a more systematic exploration of physical slum characteristics is required for the development of robust image-based proxies. Third, although the latest commercial sensor technologies provide image data of less than 0.5 m spatial resolution, thereby improving object recognition in slums, the complex and diverse morphology of slums makes extraction through standard methods difficult. Fourth, successful approaches show diversity in terms of extracted information levels (area or object based), implemented indicator sets (single or large sets) and methods employed (e.g., object-based image analysis (OBIA) or machine learning). In the context of a global slum inventory, texture-based methods show good robustness across cities and imagery. Machine-learning algorithms have the highest reported accuracies and allow working with large indicator sets in a computationally efficient manner, while the upscaling of pixel-level information requires further research. For local slum mapping, OBIA approaches show good capabilities of extracting both area- and object-based information. Ultimately, establishing a more systematic relationship between higher-level image elements and slum characteristics is essential to train algorithms able to analyze variations in slum morphologies to facilitate global slum monitoring.","funding":"University of Twente","cited":191,"publisher":"MDPI","year":2016,"volume":"8","issue":"6","pages":29},{"authors":"Pedro, Alexandra Aguiar; Queiroz, Alfredo Pereira","title":"Slum: Comparing municipal and census basemaps","source":"HABITAT INTERNATIONAL","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"Slum identification and mapping are fundamental to support public policies.

Therefore, census and remote sensing data are analyzed to create rank size distributions of morphological slums in different cities of developing countries. The observations were compared to rank size distributions of cities in a respective developing country. It is found that typical inter-urban pattern can be transferred to intra-urban pattern.

We examine factors that influence the shift in aspirations in five slum settlements using data from 500 interviews conducted in serviced and non-serviced slums from the state of Gujarat in India. The non-serviced slums did not have access to basic services namely water, sanitation, energy, roads, solid waste and rainwater management. We find empirical evidence which suggests that when basic infrastructure provisions are met, slum dwellers shift their focus from lower order aspirations to the higher order aspirations like health, education, housing and land ownership. We argue that energy provision enhances productivity and enables slum dwellers to shift their aspirations upwards. Furthermore, we test the effect of work days lost due to illness on the relationship between higher order aspirations and aspirations for energy provision. When provision of energy is low, higher work day loss dampens higher order aspirations.

Fuels use in developing countries is heterogeneous across households. This paper estimates drivers of fuel switching in non-slum and slum households in urban India, using a discrete choice model on a nationally representative micro data. The choices considered are three categories of cooking fuels: traditional firewood, dung, crop residue and coal/charcoal; modern kerosene and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG); and mixed fuels. The results suggest that the patterns of fuels use are consistent with the energy ladder theory in urban India. In addition to income, the major determinants of modern fuels uptake are fuels prices, access to electricity and water supply, and education attainment. The increasing price of LPG affects the willingness to change fuels for low-income non-slum and the high-income slum households negatively. The analyses make a strong case for applying differential subsidies on modern fuels employing multidimensional aspects of poverty. Moreover, there is a need for partial diversion of existing fuels subsidies on improving physical and social capitals, which will result in uptake of modern fuels, particularly among disadvantaged communities.

While poverty is a key predictor of clientelism, some urban poor voters are more involved in clientelistic arrangements than others. Insecure tenure, lack of access to public resources, and location in areas exposed to environmental shocks increase the vulnerability of slum dwellers. This vulnerability is used by politicians and brokers, who politicize access to scarce resources, and thus make slum dweller more exposed to clientelism. The qualitative literature has long highlighted how clientelism provides a strategy for slum dwellers to cope with their vulnerability, but this population is often excluded from quantitative analyses of clientelism. Using survey data from Argentina and a matching technique that allows us to compare slum dwellers with similar non-slum dwellers, we find that there is indeed a higher prevalence of clientelism among the former.

The analysis is based on the National Family Health Survey (2005-06) of India and highlights the dual burden of malnutrition among urban women. The results show that one in every two women in mega-cities is malnourished (either undernourished or overnourished), but a biased, analytical focus on citywide averages conceals the nature of the problem. Overnutrition among women is notably higher in non-slum areas whereas underweight persists as a key concern among slum dwellers. Cities located in the Central India (Nagpur and Indore) have the highest proportion of underweight women whereas the cities in South India (Chennai and Hyderabad) show a high prevalence of overweight women across both slum and non-slum areas. The intensity of income-related inequalities in underweight outcome is much greater for non-slum areas, whereas inequalities in overweight outcomes are higher among slums. Furthermore, regression analysis indicates that place of residence as such has no significant impact on women's nutritional status and that this elementary association is primarily a ramification mediated through other key socioeconomic correlates. Results suggest that, it would be rational to develop a comprehensive urban nutritional plan that focuses on dietary planning and behaviour change to address both type of malnutrition at the same time.

In order to improve living conditions and provide possible solutions for the major problems in slums (e.g., insufficient infrastructure), it is important to understand the current situation of this form of settlement and its development. There are many different models that attempt to simulate the development of slums. In this paper, we present data mining models that correlate information about the temporal development of slums with other economic, ecologic, and demographic factors in order to identify dependencies. Different learning algorithms, such as decision rules and decision trees, are used to learn descriptive models for slum development from data, and the results are evaluated with commonly used attribute evaluation methods known from data mining. The results confirm various previously made statements about slum development in a quantitative way, such as the fact that slum development is very strongly linked to the demographic development of a country. Applying the introduced classification models to the most recent data for different regions, it can be shown that the slum development in Africa is expected to be above average.","funding":"KSB Foundation for the project Megacities [1322]; German Research FoundationGerman Research Foundation (DFG); Open Access Publishing Fund of Technische Universitat Darmstadt","cited":45,"publisher":"MDPI","year":2018,"volume":"2","issue":"3","pages":19},{"authors":"De, Indranil","title":"Slum improvement in India: determinants and approaches","source":"HOUSING STUDIES","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"This paper investigates living conditions in Indian slums, extent of improvement of basic services between 2002 and 2012 and determinants of improvement based on National Sample Survey data.

Most of the other neighbourhood variables like provision of water, garbage collection, healthcare etc. including presence of open drain in the neighbourhood have insignificant effect on house prices. Measures of willingness to pay show strong promise of cost sharing for slum improvisation programs for facilities like sewage and street lights.

Only a handful of studies suggest a beneficial relationship between slums and health, in such areas as affordable housing provision, employment generation, and community cohesion. We argue that the literature's overwhelming emphasis on the environmental risks of slums feeds into a neoliberal urban agenda that seeks to clear slums at the expense of their beneficial contributions to health.

Slums have emerged as a significant settlement form, catering to the housing demand of a large section of the population of Mumbai, primarily for the urban poor. Statistics show that nearly half of the Mumbai population lives in slum areas which in turn spatially occupy a very small portion of the city. Since 1947 (i.e., after independence), a range of policies related to housing and slums have been implemented at various points of time in the city planning framework. However, the housing crisis situation has worsened over time and resulted in further slum growth. In the past, research has concentrated on spatio-temporal identification and spread of slums. However, the policy impacts on reduction of slums is relatively a less touched area, especially in developing cities like Mumbai. In this study, authors argue that the housing and land policies implemented in Mumbai to solve the problem of slums have actually provided the momentum to the undercurrents that fuel further proliferation of informality. The paper analyses these policies chronologically and focuses on the persuasive top down approach of policy implementation. Using the framework of bounded rationality, authors develop a cause-effect model to identify the impact of ten major housing and land policies implemented since independence. Further, a gap coherence analysis revealed the lack of participation of direct stakeholders (i.e., the slum dwellers).

A case of slum declaration in Pune, India","source":"URBAN STUDIES","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"Though previous studies have examined how formalising land tenure affects housing improvements in informal settlements, the role of tenure security and its long-term influence remain unclear. In response, this paper quantitatively examines the extent to which formalising land tenure by way of slum declaration has stimulated housing improvements during the last three decades in the slums of Pune, India. Since slum declaration guarantees residents occupancy but not full property rights, this study focuses on how tenure security contributes to housing outcomes, such as materials, size, the number of floors and the amount of money spent for the improvements. Using original household survey data, analysis involving propensity score matching and difference-in-differences methods reveals that slum declaration has tripled a household's likelihood of having added a second floor and, albeit less clear, increased the average amount of money spent on housing improvements. At the same time, slum declaration has not induced any improvement in housing materials, largely since many residents of non-formalised slums have also replaced materials. These results indicate that slum declaration, even in the long run, has continued to influence housing investments in Pune's slums, in terms of both type and amount spent, though residents of non-formalised slums have also come to enjoy certain de facto tenure security. Among other implications for policy, these findings underscore that governments should at least provide legal assurance of occupancy rights in informal settlements, even if active interventions such as slum upgrading and titling are currently difficult.","funding":"National Science Foundation's Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement GrantsNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE) [1303019]","cited":46,"publisher":"SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD","year":2017,"volume":"54","issue":"7","pages":21},{"authors":"Frenzel, Fabian; Koens, Ko; Steinbrink, Malte; Rogerson, Christian M.","title":"SLUM TOURISM: STATE OF THE ART","source":"TOURISM REVIEW INTERNATIONAL","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"This article provides a view on the state-of-the-art literature on slum tourism.

We examine these questions using the primary household survey conducted in 2016-2017 as part of a project on urban slums of the four largest cities in Bihar. The regression analysis shows that slum dwellers are more likely to accept in situ slum upgrading when they perceive a pressing need for housing and basic amenities. In situ slum upgrading often leads to temporary relocation and smaller dwellings. Slum dwellers are more likely to participate in relocation programs when they feel their neighborhoods are insecure, and when they have experienced violent resolutions to conflicts.

UN-Habitat reports that, in 2001, approximately 924 million people lived in slums or informal settlements across the world (UN-Habitat, 2003). However, varying definitions of what constitutes a slum result in different slum population estimates. Most definitions treat a slum as a community of several households, rarely recognizing that housing conditions differ for each individual household within the area. Moreover, definitions of slums usually take a dichotomous approach whereby a place is either a slum or not. Little attempt is made to go beyond this slum/non-slum dichotomy. This paper moves beyond the traditional ways of defining a slum by proposing a new household level enumeration of slums and developing Slum Severity Index (SSI), which measures the level of deprivation on a continuous scale based on the UN-Habitat's slum definition. We apply this new approach of analyzing slums to a household survey dataset to estimate the total number of slum households in Mumbai and Kolkata, two megacities in India. To contrast our approach, we compare these estimates with the Census of India's. The comparison highlights stark differences in the two estimates and the slum/non-slum household classifications. The estimates by the Census are considerably smaller than those based on the UN-Habitat definition in both cities. By applying the SSI, we also demonstrate intra-urban variability in housing conditions within our study cities. The analysis highlights differences in slum profiles measured in terms of both housing deprivation levels and housing deprivation types in both cities.

The study finds an increasing level of slum population compared to the urban population in most Indian states, while shifting the concentration of slum population from high-income to newly growing states. We also evidence the positive impact of economic inequality on the expansion of slum population. The study concludes that the process of economic growth with exclusionary urbanisation generates urban inequality, which helps to persist the slums.","cited":59,"publisher":"BUCHAREST UNIV PRESS","year":2021,"volume":"13","issue":"2","pages":22},{"authors":"Dyson, Peter","title":"Slum Tourism: Representing and Interpreting 'Reality' in Dharavi, Mumbai","source":"TOURISM GEOGRAPHIES","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"This article examines how Dharavi is represented to, and interpreted by, tourists participating in walking tours around Mumbai's largest slum.

It is home to one million people, with almost half of residents living in spaces under 10 m(2), making it over six times as dense as daytime Manhattan. Using ethnographic fieldwork and online analysis, this article examines slum tourism and the perceptions and experiences of western visitors. Local tour operators emphasize the productivity of the slum, with its annual turnover of $665 million generated from its hutment industries. Its poor sanitation, lack of clean water, squalid conditions and overcrowding are ignored and replaced by a vision of resourcefulness, hard work and diligence. This presentation of the slum as a hive of industry is so successful that visitors overlook, or even deny, its obvious poverty. Dharavi is instead perceived as a manufacturing hub and retail experience; and in some cases even romanticized as a model of contentment and neighbourliness, with western visitors transformed by 'life-changing', 'eye-opening' and 'mind-blowing' experiences. This article concludes that the potential of slum tours as a form of international development is limited, as they enable wealthy middle-class westerners to feel 'inspired', 'uplifted' and 'enriched', but with little understanding of the need for change.","funding":"King's College London","cited":80,"publisher":"PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD","year":2017,"volume":"85","pages":9},{"authors":"Ghulam, Ram; Verma, Kamal; Sharma, Pankaj; Razdan, Monica; Razdan, Rahul Anand","title":"Drug abuse in slum population","source":"INDIAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"Substance abuse is an important health problem throughout the world including India, but prevalence and pattern of abuse varies from country to country and in different types of population.

The challenge is in their efficient, effective and inclusive management. The purpose of this paper is to frame slums in the broad aim of urban development and the pursuit of prosperity, as active players and positive contributors in every right - a slum-prosperity framework. First, however, they need to be comprehensively defined in a non-exclusive, structured, dynamic and heuristic way; a previous publication was set to resolve this challenge. Design/methodology/approach - Guided by a synthesized operative model for prosperity, such a definition for slums is used to precisely relate their characters to the pursuit of prosperity through a mapping process, whereby these characters are linked to potentials for prosperity, improvement goals, resources and intervention plans. Findings - Both slums and prosperity are fuzzy, complex and variable terms; the only possibility to deal with them both is to break them down into simple and manageable yet operative units and establish the most influential and effective links between them to organize intervention according to patterns of change in both slums and city. Research limitations/implications - An intervention agenda like the one proposed here, that gives room for contextual and temporal urban complexities, has the potential to augment urban practice and help curb the slum phenomenon. A final paper (forthcoming) will illustrate the application of both the comprehensive definition of slum and the implementation of a pathway toward prosperity. Originality/value - The proposal in this paper is derived as part of research conducted for the award of a PhD at the University of Strathclyde Glasgow. This was in general set to contribute to the proactive and inclusive improvement of slums and cities. The proposal is further derived from the authors' involvement and personal interest in developing regions and is designed on local experience and on wider expertise in urban renewal.","cited":60,"publisher":"EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD","year":2019,"volume":"13","issue":"2","pages":17},{"authors":"Friesen, John; Taubenboeck, Hannes; Wurm, Michael; Pelz, Peter F.","title":"Size distributions of slums across the globe using different data and classification methods","source":"EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"More than 900 million people worldwide live in slums.

It was designed as a cross-sectional study based on data from visitors at a clinic at Trnava University located in Mukuru slum in Nairobi. There were about 16,000 visits registered at Mary Immaculate Clinic of Trnava University in Nairobi during 2 years of operation. A random 5% sample was drawn from the paper-card database of this clinic to assess basic characteristics and health complaints of visitors. Both self-reported health complaints and diagnoses written by physicians were used to assess health status of participants. More females with average age (by slum) ranging from 20.46 to 21.30 years than males with average age ranging from (by slum) 15.86 to 19.49 years are the visitors of the clinic. The major self-reported health complaints of visitors were cough, abdominal pain, and headache for both sexes. The most frequent diagnoses were consequently virosis, acute respiratory infections, and bronchitis. Differences in health complaints by slums were observed and are described herein. The major health complaints and diagnoses in addition to the differences in health complaints and diagnoses by slum show that environmental conditions can have major influences on health status. Therefore, environmental improvements are important in the improvement of health status. A very high prevalence of respiratory complaints and gastrointestinal problems signify that improvements in air pollution reduction, drinking water provision, and waste management in slums can lead to more significant and sustainable improvements in health status than just simple treatment. This fact should be taken into account when planning future relief programs. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

The household food insecurity access scale (HFIAS) is used as a subjective measure of food security. Moreover, calorie availability and different dietary diversity scores are calculated based on 7-day food consumption recalls at the household level and 24-h dietary recalls at the individual level. The large majority of the slum households are food insecure and suffer from low dietary quality. Rates of undernourishment are considerably higher than what country-level statistics report, suggesting that slum dwellers deserve more explicit attention in initiatives to improve nutrition. Household-level indicators are significantly correlated with individual-level indicators for women and children.

It is noted that in times of crises, such as eviction or disease epidemic, the geographical slum community develops collective organizations to tackle these crises. Invariably this is through community based organization. But it is also noted that geographical slums are not homogeneous. Some neighbourhoods within the slum have the organizational ability to negotiate for services in the slum and in the wider city, while others fail. This leads to accelerated development in some areas of the geographical slum and retarded development in others. There are vulnerable groups within a vulnerable community. It is also recognized that these dynamics of differential access to services are rarely recognized by sector providers.

The findings suggest that not only formalizing slums but also supporting self-help efforts by the residents of non-formalized slums would be effective for improving their housing conditions.","cited":58,"publisher":"SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD","year":2014,"volume":"51","issue":"16","pages":25},{"authors":"Aboderin, Isabella; Kano, Megumi; Owii, Hilda Akinyi","title":"Toward Age-Friendly Slums? Health Challenges of Older Slum Dwellers in Nairobi and the Applicability of the Age-Friendly City Approach","source":"INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"A majority of urban residents in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and other developing regions live in informal settlements, or slums. Much of the discourse on slum health centres on younger generations, while an intensifying agenda on healthy ageing as yet lacks a systematic focus on slums. Similarly, the global age-friendly cities (AFC) movement does not, thus far, extend to slums. This paper examines the particular challenges that a slum-focused age-friendly initiative in SSA may need to address, and the relevance of present AFC indicators and domains for initiatives to advance the health and well-being of older slum dwellers. The analysis builds on the case of two slum communities in Nairobi, Kenya. It analyzes two bodies of relevant evidence from these settlements, namely on the health and social circumstances of older residents, and on the local application and measurement of AFC indicators. The findings point to a set of unsurprising, but also less obvious, core health and social adversities that an age- friendly initiative in such settlements would need to consider. The findings show, further, that the current AFC domains and indicators framework only partly capture these adversities, but that there is potential for adapting the framework to be meaningful for slum settings. The paper concludes by underscoring the need for, and opportunities inherent in, the pursuit of an age-friendly slums initiative going forward.","funding":"World Health OrganizationWorld Health Organization; African Population and Health Research Center","cited":45,"publisher":"MDPI AG","year":2017,"volume":"14","issue":"10","pages":13},{"authors":"Friesen, John; Lestakova, Michaela; Kaltenmorgen, Jens; Nahaganeshan, Suwaythan; Pelz, Peter E.; Taubenboeck, Hannes; Wurm, Michael","title":"Size Distributions for Morphological Slums in Asia and South America","source":"2019 JOINT URBAN REMOTE SENSING EVENT (JURSE)","language":"English","doc":"Proceedings Paper","abstract":"The size distribution of cities within countries was investigated for several years, leading to the famous Zipf's law.

While electricity problems in the rural areas are widely recognized, scholars have yet to analyze the situation in urban slums. Drawing on 2004-2005 survey data from the India Human Development Survey, we document the electricity situation in slums. We find that while households located in slums are less likely to have access to the electricity grid than other urban households, the situation is significantly better than in rural areas. Based on simulations, we find that a median household in a slum has 70% chance of having electricity. This number decreases to 50% for a household in a rural area and increases to 80% for households in urban areas. As to daily hours of electricity available for connected households, urban slums also fall between other urban and rural areas. Finally, we show that these conditions vary considerably by state. Slums located in states with low corruption and leftist governments have better electricity access on average than those in states suffering from corruption or that are ruled by rightist parties.

This observation has mainly been attributed to what is commonly known as the urban advantage. This urban advantage is associated with increased access to facilities such as schools in urban areas. Recent work documenting population health in urban and rural areas has however begun to suggest that some sections of the urban population do not benefit from the urban advantage. For example, a child in the slums of Nairobi is more likely to suffer from diarrhea than a child in rural Kenya. In addition, a child from the richest household in the slums is more likely to suffer from diarrhea than a child from the poorest family in rural Kenya. This paper explores patterns of school enrollment comparing urban slum, urban non-slum and rural children. The paper uses data from the Kenya Demographic and Health Survey (KDHS) for 1993, 1998 and 2003. A contrast with school enrollment in Nairobi slums is done using the KDHS-type Nairobi Cross Sectional Slum Survey for 2000. Data from focus group discussions collected in the slums of Nairobi provide the context for discussion. The results suggest that school enrollment is higher in urban non-slum than in urban slum areas, and is higher in slums than in rural areas at younger ages. However, this is only true up to age 9 for females and 11 for males, from which school enrollment for slum children declines and the rate of decline is faster than among their rural counterparts. The corresponding ages at which the enrollment among the rural children begins to visibly decline are 13 years for males and 14 years for females. Factors contributing to these results point to the poor quality of primary schools in slums, limited access to secondary school for slum children, increased vulnerability to coercion into sexual activity and other ills that hinder school participation, disabling environment at home and increased child labor.

Both housing demand and demand for housing attributes are further stratified by settlement type slum and non-slum, and by tenure - owner and renter. The estimation results indicate that housing demand is inelastic with respect to price and income, whereas the magnitude of price elasticity is overall smaller than that of income elasticity in absolute term. In slum households, however, price elasticity is larger than income elasticity. The estimates of housing attributes also show that floor area, availability of a separate kitchen, permanent material of roof, independent latrine, drainage, and flat type of dwelling structure, among others, are important determinants of rent. In slum households, however, only quantity variables matter while quality variables have little effect on rent. This study concludes with policy prescriptions including sufficient urban land supply, which is required to cope with income growth of non-slum households on one hand and to provide low cost dwelling for slum household on the other hand.

However, there is limited empirical evidence on whether slum dwellers find housing options with improved tenure security preferable and whether they can afford such options. This study identifies the causal effects of improving land tenure security on slum dwellers' preferences and abilities to afford alternative, upgraded housing options. To this end, it employs a conjoint experiment embedded in a public opinion survey on a sample of 3,715 respondents from five urban slums in Nairobi and its outskirts. Our experiment has three main findings. First, slum dwellers prefer a more secure land tenure type rather than contested land when considering where to live, but this preference depends on the respondents' informal settlement, occupation, and stated reasons for living in the slum. Second, improvement of land tenure security has almost no influence on slum dwellers' abilities to afford upgraded housing options. Instead, the cost of rent is the most important factor determining affordability. Finally, slum dwellers' preferences and affordability frequently do not overlap. For instance, over half (56%) of the respondents who prefer the housing option with a more secure land tenure type-that is, land with clear ownership-over contested land are unable to afford it. Therefore, improving land tenure security alone will have limited success in helping slum dwellers transition to housing options with improved living conditions. Instead of one-size-fits-all land formalization policies aiming at improving land tenure security, policies should be designed specifically for each informal settlement to address its residents' unique needs and interests.","funding":"International Development Research Centre [108242]","cited":36,"publisher":"PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD","year":2019,"volume":"93","pages":14},{"authors":"Pramadi, Yoka; Hananto, Praditya Mer; Fathy, Rusydan; Rachmawan, Dicky; Rabbani, Hidayatullah","title":"Community Participation, Sustainable Development and Slum Settlements in Jakarta","source":"PROCEEDINGS OF THE 1ST INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT (ICESSD 2019)","language":"English","doc":"Proceedings Paper","abstract":"One of the SDG (Sustainable Development Goals) programs being implemented by the Indonesia government is Sustainable Cities and Communities: Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable.

Dhaka is a rapidly urbanising megacity in one of the world's most densely populated and poorest countries. Almost 30% of its more than 14 million population lives in slums characterised by tenure insecurity and evictions, and controlled by ganglords who charge exorbitant rates for basic services. Such a situation deters investments for improving living conditions. Poor quality housing is typical and basic public are non-existent or very limited. A combination of human and natural factors results in various urban hazards with serious impacts on the poor. Flooding and water-logging due to poor drainage are widespread; windstorms and urban fires cause havoc in slums because of the weak construction of houses; unplanned urbanisation and sub-standard building practices pose great risk in the event of a major earthquake; Bangladesh is severely threatened by climate change and erratic weather, increased flooding and temperature rise are evident. Bangladesh has a large number of development agencies, but most do not engage in cities. The Urban Partnerships for Poverty Reduction (UPPR) program is unique and is a very large program targeted for 3 million slum dwellers in 30 cities including Dhaka; WaterAid Bangladesh addresses water, sanitation and hygiene (WaSH) in slums; the Coalition for the Urban Poor (CUP) is a network of more than 40 NGOs and advocates for the rights of slum dwellers, and supports community-based organisations in slum settlements. The challenges of building resilience in slums are many, but there are also opportunities. Particularly recent government policies on urban development and climate change, as well as an emerging interest among agencies to address urban issues, offer potential for advocacy for building resilience in urban slums.

In this paper we investigate Tilly's theory on group segregation and how it reproduces or reinforces inequality within the slums of Bengaluru. We apply statistical techniques (correspondence analysis and regression) to novel field data from 37 slums in Bengaluru. First, we find high levels of spatial and group segregation by religion across the slums of Bengaluru. Second, we find that segregation leads to opportunity bias among slum dwellers, which inhibits equitable access to jobs in the labour market. Finally, the results show that insufficient access to resources constrain the income generation and leads to emerging coping strategies. The results indicate that group identity is key to addressing disparity and how solving inequality can drastically impact group identity.

The socio-economic conditions of the community, the use of space, the ownership status of land and buildings, the condition of infrastructure and facilities of settlements in coastal slums as a basis for the reconstruction of coastal slums handling models based on dynamic governance. The findings show that urban slum in coastal areas are very rapidly growing. Problems that continue along with various programs carried out by the government. All programs by the state and non-state have been carried out in an effort to eradicate slum areas, but in fact the poverty rate in the region continues to increase. Managing a slums settlement program can use a dynamic governance framework: thinking ahead, thinking again, and thinking across. All of these strategies have been internalized of digital information and communication technology.","cited":36,"publisher":"UNIV MUHAMMADIYAH MAKASSAR, FAC SOCIAL & POLITICAL SCIENCES","year":2019,"volume":"9","issue":"1","pages":14},{"authors":"Saharan, Tara; Pfeffer, Karin; Baud, Isa","title":"Urban Livelihoods in Slums of Chennai: Developing a Relational Understanding","source":"EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT RESEARCH","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"As South Asia urbanizes, urban poverty is becoming more important in the development agenda.

This study analyses the location of some selected slums in the Kumasi Metropolis and assesses the socio-economic and environmental effects of the activities of the slum dwellers. For the purpose of this study, 260 slum households from Aboabo and Ayigya Zongo, all slums in the Kumasi Metropolis, were randomly selected and interviewed. The results showed that the spatial location of slums within the Kumasi Metropolis is influenced by the availability of undesirable vacant lands. Migrants to the city and other poor households squat on these lands, which later develop into slums. The activities of the slum dwellers were associated with environmental problems such as river pollution and poor environmental sanitation. On the socio-economic front, poor state of health, lower educational outcomes and higher noise emission levels were identified. Based on the findings of the study, there is the need for city authorities to formulate green policies that will help transform these unattractive lands into green spaces to halt the development and expansion of slums. The researchers further recommend that, there is the need for city authorities to deepen environmental awareness campaigns in these slums to guarantee uptake of positive attitude towards the management and utilization of environmental resources in the Metropolis.","cited":47,"publisher":"SPRINGER","year":2021,"volume":"86","issue":"6","pages":15},{"authors":"Raju, Dhushyanth; Kim, Kyoung Yang; Quynh Thu Nguyen; Govindaraj, Ramesh","title":"Cities, slums, and child nutrition in Bangladesh","source":"REVIEW OF DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"This study uses novel household survey data that are representative of Bangladesh's large cities, and of slum and nonslum areas within the cities, to investigate the effects of demographic and socioeconomic factors on child nutrition status in 2013.

This figure continues to grow as developing countries rapidly urbanize. Yet, the implications of these trends for urban poverty and social mobility are not well understood. While some argue slums provide temporary housing for rural migrants as they accumulate savings and eventually move to middle class neighborhoods, others argue slum residents are stuck in poverty traps. Deficits in longitudinal data on slums make it difficult to analyze the extent of social mobility. We iterate between satellite analysis and field knowledge to build an original sample of more than 9000 slum households across more than 200 slums from three Indian cities. To address the limitations inherent in cross-sectional data, we employ multiple methods and triangulate findings across household survey data, neighborhood focus group data, longitudinal satellite data, and in-depth qualitative interviews. While no one analysis is definitive on its own, all of these results point to the same conclusion: slum residents are neither stuck in poverty traps nor are they on a steady trajectory to joining the middle class. Movement out of neighborhoods, particularly to non-slum neighborhoods, is rare. Most households experience upward mobility within their neighborhoods, but the extent of improvement is capped at a low level, and, as opportunities increase, volatility increases in parallel. Plateauing and volatility are features present in low-end, and even more, in high-end slums. Engendering better livelihood opportunities requires reducing downward mobility while addressing the causes of plateauing upward mobility. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Poverty is multidimensional and there is no agreement on a universal definition. UN-HABITAT has introduced an operational definition of slums that is restricted to legal aspects and excludes the more difficult social dimensions. The World Health Organization definition is more comprehensive and uses a health and social determinants approach that is strongly based on the social conditions in which people live and work. Health and improving the lives of people living in slums is at the top of international development agenda. Proactive strategies to contain new urban populations and slum upgrading are the two key approaches. Regarding the latter, participatory upgrading that most often involves the provision of basic infrastructure is currently the most acceptable intervention in developing countries. In urbanization of poverty, participatory slum upgrading is a necessary but not sufficient condition to reduce poverty and improve the lives of slum dwellers. Empowering interventions that target capacity development and skill transfer of both individuals and community groups-as well as meaningful negotiations with institutions, such as municipal governments, which can affect slum dwellers' lives-appear to be the most promising strategies to improve the slum dwellers' asset bases and health. Non-governmental organizations, training institutions, and international development partners are best placed to facilitate horizontal relationships between individuals, community groups, and vertical relationships with more powerful institutions that affect the slum dwellers' lives.

However, such global estimates do not provide a full description of different types of deprivations experienced by the urban poor, often resulting in inaccurate estimates of the extent of housing challenge. An all-encompassing, single analytical category of slums limits its usefulness for planning and policymaking purposes. Slum population as an urban metric also presents challenge for comparative analysis mainly because slum definitions vary country by country. We argue that current approaches of slum enumeration fail to recognize the true extent and nature of housing deprivations, effectively undermining the urgent need to address housing issues for urban poor in developing countries and rarely providing any basis for concrete policy actions. We use a methodological framework originally developed by Patel et al. (2014) and apply it to a large-scale dataset from Census of India (2011) consisting of 1% sample of India's entire urban population. This is one of the first studies to use a large-scale micro-data to provide reliable estimates of the extent and nature of multiple housing deprivations in the country. This paper demonstrates how India's official slum statistics underestimate the extent of housing problems in India. Moreover, we show how levels of multiple deprivations may be useful in identifying the most deprived populations and, by logical extension, targeting the most deservingbeneficiaries of slum policies. Further, the paper discusses how such an approach can be helpful in determining types of interventions and targeting beneficiaries. The approach can be easily expanded to other countries and significantly contribute to current debates about measurement and monitoring of Sustainable Development Goals pertaining to housing and basic services for the urban poor across the globe.","cited":68,"publisher":"PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD","year":2020,"volume":"101","pages":13},{"authors":"Hassan, Sherif Maher; Mahabir, Ron","title":"Urban Slums and Fertility Rate Differentials","source":"POPULATION REVIEW","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"Over the last 50 years, least developed countries have experienced dramatic population growth due to high fertility rates and poor economic conditions within these countries.

Often, however, traditional data collection methods lack information on the spatial distribution of slum-dwellers. Remote sensing based methods could be used for a rapid inventory of the location and physical composition of slums. (Semi-)automatic detection of slums in image data is challenging, owing to the high variability in appearance and definitions across different contexts. This paper develops an ontological framework to conceptualize slums using input from 50 domain-experts covering 16 different countries. This generic slum ontology (GSO) comprises concepts identified at three levels that refer to the morphology of the built environment: the environs level, the settlement level and the object level. It serves as a comprehensive basis for image-based classification of slums, in particular, using object-oriented image analysis (OOA) techniques. This is demonstrated by with an example of local adaptation of GSO and OOA parameterization for a study area in Kisumu, Kenya. At the object level, building and road characteristics are major components of the ontology. At the settlement level, texture measures can be potentially used to represent the contrast between planned and unplanned settlements. At the environs level, factors which extend beyond the site itself are important indicators, e.g. hazards due to floods plains and marshy conditions. The GSO provides a comprehensive framework that includes all potentially relevant indicators that can be used for image-based slum identification. These characteristics may be different for other study areas, but show the applicability of the developed framework. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Consequently, the urban poor often use inexpensive pit latrines and at the same time may draw domestic water from nearby wells. Overcrowding in slums limits the adequate distance between wells and pit latrines so that micro-organisms migrate from latrines to water sources. Sanitary practices in these overcrowded slums are also poor, leading to contamination of these wells. This study sought to assess sanitary practices of residents of a Kenyan urban slum and fecal contamination of their domestic water sources. This cross-sectional study involved 192 respondents from Langas slum, Kenya. Forty water samples were collected from the water sources used by the respondents for laboratory analysis of coliforms. Of these 40 samples, 31 were from shallow wells, four from deep wells, and five from taps. Multiple-tube fermentation technique was used to enumerate coli form bacteria in water. The study found that most people (91%) in the Langas slum used wells as the main source of domestic water, whereas the rest used tap water. Whereas most people used pit latrines for excreta disposal, a substantial percentage (30%) of children excreted in the open field. The estimated distance between the pit latrines and the wells was generally short with about 40% of the pit latrines being less than 15 m from the wells. The main domestic water sources were found to be highly contaminated with fecal matter. Total coliforms were found in 100% of water samples from shallow wells, while 97% of these samples from shallow wells were positive for thermotolerant coliforms. Three out of the four samples from deep wells were positive for total coliforms, while two of the four samples were positive for thermotolerant coliforms. None of the samples from taps were positive for either total or thermotolerant coliforms. Because the presence of thermotolerant coliforms in water indicates fecal contamination, facilitated by the proximity between the wells and pit latrines, the study suggests that the pit latrines were a major source of contamination of the wells with fecal matter. However, contamination through surface runoff during rains is also plausible as indiscriminate excreta disposal particularly by children was also common. Owing to the fecal contamination, there is a high possibility of the presence of disease pathogens in the water; thus, the water from the wells in Langas may not be suitable for human consumption. To address this problem, treatment of the water at community or household level and intensive behavioral change in sanitary practices are recommended. Efforts should be made to provide regulated tap water to this community and to other slums in sub-Saharan Africa where tap water is not accessible.","cited":35,"publisher":"SPRINGER","year":2007,"volume":"84","issue":"6","pages":10},{"authors":"Yoelin, Ann B.; Saunders, Nathan W.","title":"Score Disparity Between the MMSE and the SLUMS","source":"AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ALZHEIMERS DISEASE AND OTHER DEMENTIAS","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"Background: Multiple brief cognitive instruments are available to assess cognitive impairment in older adults. However, not all instruments demonstrate the same effectiveness when utilized with higher educated adults. This study evaluates the score disparity between the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the St. Louis University Mental Status (SLUMS) Examination across the education spectrum. It was hypothesized that individuals with more years of formal education would produce higher scores on both the MMSE and SLUMS. Previous research was conducted to create a conversion scale used to compare and convert the MMSE scores to SLUMS scores. This research study provides additional data to add to the body of knowledge regarding a conversion scale for the MMSE and SLUMS. Methods: Seventy-five adults older than the age of 60 years were each administered the MMSE and SLUMS. Results: Contrary to our hypothesis, individuals with more years of formal education did not produce significantly greater scores on the MMSE or SLUMS. Likewise, education level analyzed as a continuous measure was not significantly correlated with the MMSE, r(75) = -0.191, or SLUMS, r(75) = 0.019. Interestingly, among participants with a high (but not low) education level, there was a marginal but significant difference in mean score between the MMSE (29.00 1.47) and SLUMS (27.74 +/- 3.08), t(64) = 3.70, P < .001. Conclusion: Other factors besides education may impact the performance of older adults on the MMSE and SLUMS, but it does appear that education level may moderate the score disparity between the 2 instruments.

Rapid urbanisation and the growth of slums in developing countries such as Bangladesh has led to slum upgrading as an approach to address the problems of the urban poor. The project here was in essence such a slum upgrading project, targeted at an urban slum settlement called Talab Camp in Dhaka, Bangladesh, where the residents comprised an ethnic Bihari community. Dhaka is a rapidly urbanising megacity in one of the world's most densely populated and poorest countries, where almost 30% of its more than 14 million population lives in slums and faces the impacts of a range of hazards, hence the need for building resilience. The project began with a study of this urban context to identify the challenges and opportunities for building resilience in slums there, followed by a sequence of inter-related activities. This consisted of provision of training to local professionals on concepts and applications of Urban Resilience and toolkits for Risk Assessment and Action Planning; a Community Based Participatory Risk Assessment (CBPRA) to identify the inter-related hazards and vulnerabilities affecting Talab Camp, supplemented by a survey of city level institutional actors; and a set of pilot activities guided by the above and Community Action Planning (CAP) workshops, together with community capacity building and developing community organisations. Three main risks were prioritised for addressing in the pilot activities inadequate drainage, inadequate waste disposal and poor sanitation, and thereby focused on WaSH (drainage, community toilets, water supply, and water purification), solid waste management (household and community level waste collection and disposal), housing improvement (plinth-raising above flood level) and awareness raising (cleaning event and billboards). The pilot activities also included extensive training and capacity building activities. A long-term Community Development Plan (CDP) was also developed in parallel to the pilot activities. The project faced a number of challenges in terms of local expectations, capacity building, and working in a megacity like Dhaka. A number of key lessons were learnt including the time required for adequate community consultation and participation, and unpredictability of political circumstances, in addition to a set of other lessons that can inform future such projects.

The model takes into account individual selection and location differences in returns to education, productivity, and housing rents. I find that demolishing slums in the most productive areas decreases the urban population, with negative effects on welfare and no gains in labor productivity. In contrast, eliminating formal housing distortions increases the urban population while decreasing the presence of slums by a significant amount. It also increases welfare and labor productivity by 6.8 and 1.3 percent, respectively.","cited":47,"publisher":"ELSEVIER","year":2021,"volume":"140","pages":23},{"authors":"Izutsu, Takashi; Tsutsumi, Atsuro; Islam, Akramul Md.; Kato, Seika; Wakai, Susumu; Kurita, Hiroshi","title":"Mental health, quality of life, and nutritional status of adolescents in Dhaka, Bangladesh: Comparison between an urban slum and a non-slum area","source":"SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"This study aims to clarify the quality of life (QOL), mental health, and nutritional status of adolescents in Dhaka city, Bangladesh by comparing non-slum areas and slums, and to find the factors associated with their mental health problems.

However, little is known about the distribution of this illness within subpopulations of these countries, particularly among those who live in urban informal settlements. A cross-sectional hypertension survey was conducted in 2003 among 5649 adult residents of a slum settlement in the city of Salvador, Brazil. Hypertension was defined as either an elevated arterial systolic (a parts per thousand yen140 mmHg) or diastolic (a parts per thousand yen90 mmHg) blood pressure. Sex-specific multivariable models of systolic blood pressure were constructed to identify factors associated with elevated blood pressure. The prevalence of hypertension in the population 18 years and older was 21 % (1162/5649). Men had 1.2 times the risk of hypertension compared with women (95 % confidence intervals (CI), 1.05, 1.36). Increasing age and lack of any schooling, particularly for women, were also significantly associated with elevated blood pressure (p < 0.05). There was also a direct association between men who were black and an elevated blood pressure. Among those who were hypertensive, 65.5 % were aware of their condition, and only 36.3 % of those aware were actively using anti-hypertensive medications. Men were less likely to be aware of their diagnosis or to use medications (p < 0.01 for both) than women. The prevalence of hypertension in this slum community was lower than reported frequencies in the non-slum population of Brazil and Salvador, yet both disease awareness and treatment frequency were low. Further research on hypertension and other chronic non-communicable diseases in slum populations is urgently needed to guide prevention and treatment efforts in this growing population.","funding":"Brazilian National Research CouncilConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ) [300.861/96-6]; Oswaldo Cruz Foundation [0250.250.102]; US National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [R01 AI052473, U01 AI088752, D43 TW00919, R25 TW009338]; Fogarty International Center/Ellison Medical Foundation Fellowship in Global Health and Clinical Research [TW00018]; FOGARTY INTERNATIONAL CENTERUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Fogarty International Center (FIC) [R01TW009504, R25TW009338, D43TW000919, D43TW000018] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [R01AI052473, U01AI088752] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","cited":60,"publisher":"SPRINGER","year":2015,"volume":"92","issue":"3","pages":14},{"authors":"Smit, Suzanne; Musango, Josephine Kaviti; Kovacic, Zora; Brent, Alan C.","title":"Conceptualising slum in an urban African context","source":"CITIES","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"Increasing urbanisation and the proliferation of slums require a holistic understanding of the urban metabolism of cities. However, existing urban metabolic analyses exclude a detailed understanding of how urban slums function and contribute to biophysical, including energy, flows. This paper aims at filling this gap by critically investigating the notion of the urban slum in general, the extent to which it differs in the African context, specifically in South Africa, and broadening the understanding of urban slum based on the concept of urban metabolism, using the multi-scale integrated analysis of societal and ecosystem metabolism (MuSIASEM) approach, which was applied to the Enkanini informal settlement in Stellenbosch, South Africa. The analysis shows that South Africa has a more nuanced typology of the notion of urban slums categorised as: (i) townships; (ii) housing-turned-slum; (iii) squatter camps; (iv) site and service settlements; (v) transit camps; and (vi) hybrid multi-struCtured settlements. Beyond these definitions, the case study illustrates that urban slums, however defined, are complex systems with their own internal flows and processes that are connected in a myriad of ways to the larger urban system. The investigation into the use of Time, Money and Energy in the Enkanini case further revealed the productive (hypercyclic) and consumptive (dissipative) nature of the components of the urban informal settlement. This type of analysis reveals new insights into the linkages between urban informal settlements and the city. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This urbanizing trend has been accompanied by an increasing number of people living in urban poor communities and slums. Lower immunization coverage is found in poorer urban dwellers in many contexts. This study aims to identify factors associated with immunization coverage in poor urban areas and slums, and to identify interventions to improve coverage. Methods: We conducted a systematic review, searching Medline, Embase, Global Health, CINAHL, Web of Science and The Cochrane Database with broad search terms for studies published between 2000 and 2016. Results: Of 4872 unique articles, 327 abstracts were screened, leading to 63 included studies: 44 considering factors and 20 evaluating interventions (one in both categories) in 16 low or middle-income countries. A wide range of socio-economic characteristics were associated with coverage in different contexts. Recent rural-urban migration had a universally negative effect. Parents commonly reported lack of awareness of immunization importance and difficulty accessing services as reasons for under-immunization of their children. Physical distance to clinics and aspects of service quality also impacted uptake. We found evidence of effectiveness for interventions involving multiple components, especially if they have been designed with community involvement. Outreach programmes were effective where physical distance was identified as a barrier. Some evidence was found for the effective use of SMS (text) messaging services, community-based education programmes and financial incentives, which warrant further evaluation. No interventions were identified that provided services to migrants from rural areas. Conclusion: Different factors affect immunization coverage in different urban poor and slum contexts. Immunization services should be designed in collaboration with slum-dwelling communities, considering the local context. Interventions should be designed and tested to increase immunization in migrants from rural areas.","funding":"Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene","cited":105,"publisher":"BMC","year":2017,"volume":"17","pages":16},{"authors":"Zaman, Tabrez Uz; Dutta, Sujit Kumar","title":"Struggle of Slum Dwellers for Maintaining their Health Status and Behavior in a Slum Pocket of Guwahati City","source":"INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MEDICAL RESEARCH & HEALTH SCIENCES","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"The deficient transition of the health facilities and services from the state to the local level has made the slum areas neglected at the global as well as at the micro level.

This study first investigates land allocation in slums, then the available social capital, and subsequently how this capital influences resilience to the threat of eviction in slums. Data were collected in two slum communities, in Lagos, through in-depth interviews and focus groups discussion. This study shows that land allocation is done by the traditional heads, contrarily to the mandate of the Nigeria Land Use Act of 1978. Furthermore, there is a form of structural social capital through the presence of government registered community development associations in the slums; however, their activities, decision-making process and the perception of the residents' towards their respective associations, differs. This led to differences in trust, social cohesion and bonding ties among residents of the slum, thereby influencing resilience to the threat of eviction in slums. Since community group associations, through the appointed executives, drive the efficient utilization of social capital in slums, this study therefore recommends their restructuring in order to support a sustainable solution to the threat of eviction in slums in Lagos.","funding":"Research Network for Geosciences in Berlin and Potsdam under the Geo.X young academy program","cited":97,"publisher":"MDPI","year":2021,"volume":"13","issue":"7","pages":18},{"authors":"Sahandi, Ilza Jalal","title":"An Analysis to Challenges of Management System in Slum Upgrading Projects of Iran","source":"CONSTRUCTION AND PROJECT MANAGEMENT, ICCPM 2011","language":"English","doc":"Proceedings Paper","abstract":"Tackling the issue of informal settlements, under-serviced neighborhoods, or what is generally referred to as urban slums remains a daunting task for urban management system in a majority of developing countries under both rapidly-growing and stagnant economic conditions.

Slums are typically overcrowded, with most residents sharing a single room with four to five family members. There is usually no formal sewage or waste disposal system. Open sewage, with antimicrobial-resistant organisms, typically flows just outside the door, which during the rainy season often enters the home and contaminates the household drinking source.

Understanding the spatial heterogeneity of slums in terms of scale and anisotropy from discrete image pixels is nontrivial and has not been explicitly addressed by image-based studies detecting slums, where scale and direction in characterizing slum features are commonly done by trial and error. This study addresses this gap by analyzing the impact of scales and anisotropy detected in the scale space and frequency domain for the calculation of texture indices that ultimately govern the detection of slums. Employing case studies of three cities with a large portion of slum population and for which we have very high resolution satellite imagery, we identify the characteristic scales of slum and formal built-up areas. Results show that the characteristic scales correspond with the optimal grain size to obtain image texture features for detecting slums, while the directional spectral energy at the pixel level identifies characteristic directions. Thus texture indices calculated at the characteristic scale and along the characteristic directions of slum patterns improve the efficiency in feature extraction and classification of slums, where optimizing the scale has a higher impact on the detection of slums than choosing the optimal directions. This study provides a framework for scientifically selecting optimal scales and directions for slum mapping studies. The framework is recommended to be tested for more general applications in land surface characterization and classification especially by using high order texture indices.","funding":"SimCity project [C.2324.0293]; Dynaslum (Data Driven Modelling and Decision Support for Slums) project [27015G05]","cited":47,"publisher":"ELSEVIER SCI LTD","year":2019,"volume":"73","pages":13},{"authors":"Kohli, Divyani; Stein, Alfred; Sliuzas, Richard","title":"Uncertainty analysis for image interpretations of urban slums","source":"COMPUTERS ENVIRONMENT AND URBAN SYSTEMS","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"Image interpretations are used to identify slums in object-oriented image analysis (OOA).

In India, urban slums constituting about 22.6% of the urban population are the poor and socially disadvantaged. This slum community is least concerned for school enrollment of their children inspite of the fact that primary education is compulsory and is free in public schools. In urban areas schools available are mostly of private sector that are not free and beyond affordability to slums; government and corporation schools are few, but beyond reach. Motive of the parents is to involve children in income generating activities and the girls are more deprived of school enrollment in poorer society. The, present analysis aim to: 1) assess the enrollment status of slum children and 2) determine the factors influencing school enrollment. Methodology: The data was collected during 2011-12 from 15 randomly selected slums out of 227 in which a total of 893 families were contacted and mothers with children aged 5-15 years interrogated. In addition to child history on age, sex and school enrollment, the family background characteristics were e.g. religion, caste, and family size as well as age, education and occupation of both mother & father were recorded. Results: Out of 1145 children, male and female equal represented; mostly (90.9%) were Hindus and half were SC/ST class. About 30% father and 57.2% mothers were illiterate; about half fathers were unskilled-worker and 96.0% mother's house wife. Education of father and mother had significant role to enrollment but not the age and occupation of father and mother. Female child enrollment was poor if father was in business and mother was aged. Logistic regression analysis indicated that school enrollment of children aged 5-7 years was associated with age of mother and educational combination of father and mother, while of children 8-15 years caste/religion, family size, sex of child and educational combination of father and mother were found associated. Conclusion: Findings suggest that slum community as a whole is the pocket constituted by habitats of socially disadvantaged class has to be promoted with attitudinal change to schooling of their children without discriminating child sex.","cited":7,"publisher":"INDIAN ASSOC PREVENTIVE & SOCIAL MEDICINE","year":2016,"volume":"28","issue":"1","pages":7},{"authors":"Satu, Shammi Akter; AkterJuthi, Rowshon Ara","title":"Factors, Nature and Impacts of Slum Dwellers Residential Mobility within the Dhaka City","source":"INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUILT ENVIRONMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"The pattern of residential mobility varies throughout the world.

The objectives of this study are: (1) to identify the significant factors of residential mobility of slum dwellers; and (2) to examine the patterns of residential mobility of slum dwellers in three slums area located in Dhaka. This study further analyzed the impacts of residential mobility on the socio-economic aspect of the slum dwellers. For this research purpose, 267 households from three slums of Dhaka namely Kallyanpur slum, Agargaon slum, and Karwan Bazar railgate slum were selected through non-probability convenience sampling and interviewed. This study found that residential mobility was influenced by factors which are related to life cycle; employment, income and distress; land tenure and homeownership; neighbourhood condition and grouping issues. Among all the studied variables the most five significant factors influencing residential mobility are slum eviction, unavailability of utility services, marriage, changing job and getting homeownership status. It is revealed that the nature of the residential mobility for the surveyed slum dwellers is mainly negative and it poses a significant impact on the socio-economic aspects of life. The findings of the study pave the way to recommend specific measures for the slum dwellers to improve their condition by lessening the negative impacts of residential mobility.

In this work, 322 respondents making up the sample frame were systematically sampled from the Ashaiman slum settlement in Ghana. These respondents were made up of household heads. The various groups identified within the community were based on: places of origin; locations of residences; places of work; income levels; and employment statuses. It was found that, the tendency to support or oppose the implementation of urban regeneration had a significant relation with where a person belonged within the groups outlined above. The findings of this work are pivotal to any sustainable slum transformation in Ghana and beyond especially in African countries sharing similar traits because they inform that slum residents are open to accept a policy like UR which they expect to bring a lasting solution to their plight. The findings also provide answers as to how UR should be implemented in order to record a positive outcome.","cited":62,"publisher":"ELSEVIER SCI LTD","year":2021,"volume":"116","pages":14},{"authors":"Chowdhury, Farhat Jahan; Amin, A.

The survey results traced the severe problems that existed in both slums before the implementation of infrastructure improvement projects and reveal that after the intervention the situation has considerably improved in the slum where EA was conducted. In contrast, some problems still persist in the other slum where EA was not considered. To make it worse, the newly built infrastructures have even given rise to a set of new problems.

It is unique in that it explicitly addresses host perceptions towards slum tourism enterprises as well as charitable activities funded through slum tourism. Insights were gained through 74 semistructured interviews, conducted in the most visited areas of the slum. Four different resident perspectives are recognized: apprehensive, positive, indifferent, and skeptical. Over time, residents in Dharavi become less excited by the presence of tourists, but they do not develop a negative attitude to them. Although residents are not without criticism of tourism, and there is a lack of knowledge on tourism's contribution to community development projects, they do not view tourism as exploitative. The struggle for Dharavi will be to ensure tour operators will continue to operate in a way sensitive to the local community, as tourist numbers and competition increases.","cited":49,"publisher":"COGNIZANT COMMUNICATION CORP","year":2015,"volume":"19","issue":"1-2","pages":12},{"authors":"Roy, Debraj; Lees, Michael","title":"Understanding resilience in slums using an agent-based model","source":"COMPUTERS ENVIRONMENT AND URBAN SYSTEMS","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"The existence of slums or informal settlements is common to most cities of developing countries. In India, slums contain a wealth of diversity that is masked by a high level of poverty and insufficient access to resources. Recent studies have identified that it is important to assess the resilience of slums as they differ from one slum to another. While many slums are vulnerable to forced evictions, temporary jobs, and constant migration; few slums can respond and recover from external shocks and stress. In this paper, we investigate the resilience of slums based on novel field data from 37 slums in Bangalore. Specifically, we develop an agent-based model to understand how existing social, economic and environmental situation impacts the choices of slums. The paper makes two important findings. First, we find a high social satisfaction has a stabilizing effect, which means that despite more attractive economic opportunities, social satisfaction the slum dwellers derive from living in the neighbourhood of similar contacts is a strong motive to stay. However, given that a lack of economic opportunities causes a decline in the population, the social satisfaction will decrease as a function of the number of social contacts that move. We show that this cascading effect of emigrating population strongly depends on group identity such as religion. Second, we detect different regimes as social satisfaction increase, the population transitions from extinction to positive density dependence to density independence. Therefore, understanding the social capital of a slum community can offer insights into the ability of a slum to recover from external perturbations.","funding":"Dutch NWO, eScience agency [27015G05]","cited":35,"publisher":"ELSEVIER SCI LTD","year":2020,"volume":"80","pages":17},{"authors":"Frenzel, Fabian; Blakeman, Stephanie","title":"MAKING SLUMS INTO ATTRACTIONS: THE ROLE OF TOUR GUIDING IN THE SLUM TOURISM DEVELOPMENT IN KIBERA AND DHARAVI","source":"TOURISM REVIEW INTERNATIONAL","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"This article investigates how slums are made into a tourism attraction. We focus in particular on the role of tour guides and tour guiding operations in this process. In the tourism literature in general tour guiding has been subject to much reflection and debate. However, tour guides' role in enabling tourism in new places, in the making of attractions, has not been discussed much. Also, in the emerging research on slum tourism little attention has been given to tour guides and their roles. This article addresses both research gaps in providing insights into tour guiding in slum tourism, and by addressing the roles of tour guides in attraction making through a comparative analysis of tourism in two slums: Dharavi, in Mumbai, India, and Kibera, in Nairobi, Kenya. Based on empirical research of tour guiding operations we found that different levels of formality in tour guiding coexist across destinations. Formal tour guiding operations are more successful in establishing a slum as an attraction as they enable significant growth in tourist numbers. However, formal tour guiding operations and strong international participation in their foundation are factors that seem to undermine to some extent the creation of intimate and authentic encounters in tour guiding, preferred by some tourists. This leaves space for more informal tour guiding, with strong local ties, which are better placed to produce intimate experiences.","funding":"European UnionEuropean Commission; Aalborg University","cited":44,"publisher":"COGNIZANT COMMUNICATION CORP","year":2015,"volume":"19","issue":"1-2","pages":14},{"authors":"Auerbach, Adam Michael","title":"Neighborhood Associations and the Urban Poor: India's Slum Development Committees","source":"WORLD DEVELOPMENT","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"How do slum dwellers organize and demand development from the state?

Drawing on twenty months of fieldwork and an original survey of 1,925 residents across 80 settlements in the north Indian cities of Jaipur, Rajasthan and Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh, I find that local associations are prevalent features of political life in India's slums. These associations colloquially referred to as katchi basti vikas sarnitiyaan, or slum development committees afford residents a degree of organizational formality in otherwise informal spaces.

Sustainability is measured in two ways: through the Extended Metabolism Model that looks at resource consumption, wastes, and liveability outcomes; and, through the framework of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The study compares the sustainability of informal slum settlements in Addis Ababa with high-rise slum clearance apartments; such clearance is the model mostly used for the world's informal settlements. The results show very little difference in resource consumption and waste produced but show liveability outcomes are mixed: Economic benefit is substantially improved in the high-rise areas due to becoming part of the formal economy, but community networks and trust are substantially lost when people transfer from the slums. This paper suggests that slum policy could be shifted from the Modernist high-rise slum clearance approach to a more organic, community-based renewal of the slums themselves in which infrastructure for energy, water, and waste can be brought in. New technology that fits into community-based governance structures allows such infrastructure to be a viable option, as well as enabling formal economic benefits.

Tenure status is related to satisfaction for all ages. Environmental factors were frequently mentioned as a source of dissatisfaction. Life cycle and 'age-cohort effects' may also affect satisfaction for different age groups in terms of who is satisfied as well as the issues that are considered for satisfaction. High levels of dissatisfaction with slum life may be responsible for high out-migration in slum areas, although it does not mean that those who remain do so because they are satisfied. At the same time, challenges associated with slum life do not automatically signify dissatisfaction. Perceived success, as well as conditions in the area of origin can be used to explain and understand satisfaction/dissatisfaction with slum life.

A multistage cluster area random sampling process was used to identify households and individuals for the survey. Household surveys included rosters of residents, household characteristics, adult and child deaths in the past year, child health, and healthcare access and utilization. Individual surveys of two randomly sampled adults from each household included sociodemographic data, maternal health, and adult health. Additionally, blood pressure, height, weight, and psychological distress were measured by study staff. Data were weighted for complex survey design and non-response. A total of 525 households and 894 individuals completed the survey (96% household and 90% individual response rate, respectively). The estimated population density was 58,000 persons/km(2). Across slums, 55% of all residents were female, and 38% were adolescents and youth 1024 years. Among adults, 58% were female with median age 29 years (22-38). The most common adult illnesses were severe psychological distress (24%), hypertension (20%), history of physical injury/trauma (10%), asthma (7%), history of cholera (4%), and history of tuberculosis (3%). Ten percent of adults had obesity (BMI > 30 kg/m(2)), and 7% currently smoked. The most common under-5 diseases during the last 3 months were respiratory and gastrointestinal illnesses (50% and 28%, respectively). One-third of households reported needing medical care for a child in the past year but not being able to access it, largely due to financial constraints. Unique features of these slums are a population structure dominated by adolescents and youth, a high proportion of females, and a high burden of non-communicable diseases including hypertension and psychological distress. Screening, diagnostic, and disease management interventions are urgently needed to protect and promote improved population health outcomes in these slum communities.","funding":"NIH FogartyUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Fogarty International Center (FIC) [3D43TW009606-03S1, D43TW009337]; NHLBIUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Heart Lung & Blood Institute (NHLBI) [R01HL143788]; NIAIDUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [K24AI098627]; NICHDUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD) [R24HD041023]; EUNICE KENNEDY SHRIVER NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF CHILD HEALTH & HUMAN DEVELOPMENTUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD) [R24HD041023] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; FOGARTY INTERNATIONAL CENTERUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Fogarty International Center (FIC) [D43TW009337, D43TW009606] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL HEART, LUNG, AND BLOOD INSTITUTEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Heart Lung & Blood Institute (NHLBI) [R01HL143788] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [K24AI098627] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","cited":53,"publisher":"SPRINGER","year":2019,"volume":"96","issue":"6","pages":16},{"authors":"Debnath, Ramit; Bardhan, Ronita; Sunikka-Blank, Minna","title":"Discomfort and distress in slum rehabilitation: Investigating a rebound phenomenon using a backcasting approach","source":"HABITAT INTERNATIONAL","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"Slum rehabilitation policies in India is observed to have a rebound effect on the occupants, where rehabilitated occupants move back to the horizontal slums.

A novel methodological framework was developed to investigate it based on the principles of participatory backcasting approach and the theory of homeostasis. Thirty households in Mumbai's slum rehabilitation housing were interviewed to determine the social, economic and environmental cause of distress and discomfort. Granular information was obtained by further investigating the factors that influence occupants' attitude, emotions, health, control and habits in their built environment that regulates their holistic comfort and lack of stress. The causal linkages among these factors were established using a qualitative fault tree. Results show two primary cause of distress and discomfort in the study area owing to economic distress and built environment related discomfort. Economic distress was from low-income and high electricity bills due to higher household appliance ownership, and built environment discomfort was due to lack of social spaces and poor design of the slum rehabilitation housing. This study showed that mitigating such non income drivers of distress and discomfort can prevent rebound phenomenon and improve the sustainability of the slum rehabilitation process.","funding":"Commonwealth Scholarship Commission [INSS-2017-339]; Cambridge Trust [INSS-2017-339]; Bill & Melinda Gates FoundationBill & Melinda Gates Foundation [OPP1144]; Charles Wallace India Trust; Ministry of Human Resource Development, Government of India project 'FAST' [14MHRD005]; IRCC-IIT Bombay Fund [16IRCC561015]; British Academy Knowledge Frontiers: International Interdisciplinary Research Projects titled 'Gender and household energy: female participation in designing domestic energy in India's slum rehabilitation housing' [KF1\\100033]","cited":46,"publisher":"PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD","year":2019,"volume":"87","pages":16},{"authors":"Claret, A.

More than one billion of these people, or one in three city-dwellers, live in inadequate housing with no or a few basic resources. In Bangladesh, urban slum settlements tend to be located in low-lying, flood-prone, poorly-drained areas, having limited formal garbage disposal and minimal access to safe water and sanitation. These areas are severely crowded, with 4-5 people living in houses of just over 100 sq feet. These conditions of high density of population and poor sanitation exacerbate the spread of diseases. People living in these areas experience social, economic and political exclusion, which bars them from society's basic resources. This paper overviews policies and actions that impact the level of exclusion of people living in urban slum settlements in Bangladesh, with a focus on improving the health and rights of the urban poor. Despite some strategies adopted to ensure better access to water and health, overall, the country does not have a comprehensive policy for urban slum residents, and the situation remains bleak.","funding":"World Health Organization (WHO)World Health Organization","cited":27,"publisher":"I C D D R B-CENTRE HEALTH POPULATION RESEARCH","year":2009,"volume":"27","issue":"4","pages":13},{"authors":"Sabic, Dejan; Knezevic, Aleksandar; Vujadinovic, Snezana; Golic, Rajko; Milincic, Miroljub; Joksimovic, Marko","title":"BELGRADE SLUMS - LIFE OR SURVIVAL ON THE MARGINS OF SERBIAN SOCIETY?","source":"TRAMES-JOURNAL OF THE HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"Our research focuses on the problems of modern spatial, social and economic marginalization of the Belgrade slum population, as well as on the measures of improving the living conditions in them.

We examine the association between area of residence and child health in India, focusing on composition and selection effects. Simple height-for-age averages show that rural Indian children have the poorest health and urban children have the best, with slum children in between. With wealth or observed health environment held constant, the urban height-for-age advantage disappears, and slum children fare significantly worse than their rural counterparts. Hence, differences in composition across areas mask a substantial negative association between living in slums and height-for-age. This association is more negative for girls than boys. Furthermore, a large number of girls are missing in slums; we argue that this implies that the negative association between living in slums and health is even stronger than our estimate. The missing girls also help explain why slum girls appear to have a substantially lower mortality than rural girls, whereas slum boys have a higher mortality risk than rural boys. We estimate that slum conditions (such as overcrowding and open sewers), which the survey does not adequately capture, are associated with 20 % to 37 % of slum children's stunting risk.","funding":"Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human DevelopmentUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD) [R24 HD042828]; Office of Research and Development of National Chengchi University; Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan Government [104-2914-I-004-009-A1]; EUNICE KENNEDY SHRIVER NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF CHILD HEALTH & HUMAN DEVELOPMENTUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD) [R24HD042828] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","cited":56,"publisher":"DUKE UNIV PRESS","year":2018,"volume":"55","issue":"1","pages":25},{"authors":"Wambua, Jonesmus Mutua; Mbayaki, Regina; Munyao, Paul Musya; Kabue, Mark Mugo; Mulindi, Rose; Change, Patrick Mose; Ikamati, Rudia; Jahonga, Ruth; Ambalu, Rachel; Maranga, Wamae; Mudany, Mildred","title":"Client satisfaction determinants in four Kenyan slums","source":"INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH CARE QUALITY ASSURANCE","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"Purpose - In Kenya, gaps exist in health service provision to slum residents, especially service availability and access to quality care. There is also little information on the health status of people living in slums other than in Nairobi. The purpose of this paper is to generate evidence for use in designing interventions to improve health services in four mid-sized slums in Embu, Nyeri and Thika, Kenya. Design/methodology/approach - A cross-sectional survey of clients receiving services in health facilities was conducted in the targeted slums. Data were collected through face-to-face interviews. Factor scores were generated using the Rasch model; simple and multivariate logistic regression analyses were done using the R statistical software. Findings - Overall, 81 per cent of the 203 participants reported being satisfied with health services. Most clients (89 per cent) reported that health facility staff greeted them warmly; 82 per cent said their consultation was private. The facility type, waiting time and client experience with service providers determined their satisfaction (p<0.05). Practical implications - Healthcare managers can improve client satisfaction levels by understanding the client flow in their facilities and addressing causes of client dissatisfaction, such as long waiting times, while at the same time promoting facilitating factors. Originality/value - The authors use latent variable modelling to compute client satisfaction scores, which were dichotomised into two categories and fitted into a logistic regression model to identify factors that influence client satisfaction. Health facility clients in the four slums are satisfied with services and have confidence the providers will serve them in a friendly and professional manner that promotes respect and quality care. The paper recommend healthcare managers in similar settings carry out client flow analysis and institute remedial measures to address long waiting times. Qualitative studies are recommended to determine the reasons behind the high satisfaction levels reported in this study.","cited":26,"publisher":"EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD","year":2015,"volume":"28","issue":"7","pages":11},{"authors":"Choi, Eunhwa; Bhandari, Tulsi Ram; Shrestha, Niranjan","title":"Social inequality, noise pollution, and quality of life of slum dwellers in Pokhara, Nepal","source":"ARCHIVES OF ENVIRONMENTAL & OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH","language":"English","doc":"Article; Early Access","abstract":"This work is a cross-sectional comparative study conducted on 528 residents in the slum and non-slum areas of Pokhara, Nepal.

Prevalence and attitudes toward gender-based violence among survey participants are compared to those measured in the general population. Because results of the Kiberan survey show a higher rate of gender-based violence among women than the general population of Kenya, it appears that interventions are urgently needed in the slum. At the same time, slum-dwelling women reported lower attitudinal tolerance of gender-based violence than the larger population, supporting the readiness to accept interventions if available. The current study is one of the first to report data specifically about gender-based violence among women in Kibera and thus serves as a platform upon which larger future studies may be built.

We first present eleven images of slums and informal urbanism in south and Southeast Asia and suggest a complex mix of attractions for Western tourists. On the one hand informal urbanism can be picturesque with elements of nostalgia and a quest for authenticity; on the other is the shock of the real, the spectacle of intensive labyrinthine urbanity and an uneasy voyeurism. We suggest the attraction is more the anxious and awe-filled pleasure of the sublime than any formal beauty. The paper then changes scale to connect such imagery to the political economy and geography of the city where the visibility of slums and urban informality is linked to state and market ideologies. Informal settlements generally have negative symbolic and political capital; the developing state paradoxically needs tourists yet seeks to control the urban image for purposes of branding and to signify law and order. The slum is often hidden from the public gaze in a manner that is complicit with the reproduction of poverty. While the voyeuristic gaze of the Western tourist produces an aestheticization of poverty this does not depoliticize so much as it opens up new connections and potential transformations.","cited":33,"publisher":"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","year":2012,"volume":"14","issue":"2","pages":19},{"authors":"Sholihah, Puput Ichwatus; Chen Shaojun","title":"Impoverishment of induced displacement and resettlement (DIDR) slum eviction development in Jakarta Indonesia","source":"INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF URBAN SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"The Government of DKI Jakarta plans to free the city from slum dwellings by 2020.

This study aimed to assess the status of health-care utilization among dwellers of slums in one of the Iran's big cities. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study in which 559 slums people were selected using a random clustered sampling method. Data on health services utilization were collected using health equity assessment and response tool questionnaire. Data analysis was performed using descriptive statistics and logistic regression analysis through SPSS ver. 22. RESULTS: In this study, 42.5% (238) people who required outpatient services. 21% (118) of them were able to use them. Furthermore, among the families, who needed outpatient services during the past month, 15% (38) were able to use the services for at least once. Regarding inpatient services, 62% (349) of people needed hospitalization, of which 31% (175) were able to be hospitalized. Age (P = 0.2), gender (P = 0 < 001), marital status (P = 0 <001), income status (P = 0.1), and education (P = 0.21) determined utilization of outpatient services; however, inpatient services utilization was affected by age (P = 0.03), gender (P = 0.02), marital status (P = 0 < 001), and income status (P = 0.32).

Evidence shows that in Sub-Saharan Africa, most infectious diseases flourish during the wet months of the year; while human activities in a context of constrained choices in life exacerbate the effects of seasons on human health. The paper argues that, the wet season and when human activities are at their peak, sanitation is most dire poor slum populations. Methods: A shared latrine cleaning observation was undertaken over a period of 6 months in the slums of Kampala city. Data was collected through facility observations, user group meetings, Focus group discussions and, key informant interviews. The photos of the observed sanitation facilities were taken and assessed for facility cleanliness or dirt. Shared latrine pictures, observations, Focus Group Discussion, community meetings and key informant interviews were analysed and subjected to an analysis over the wet, dry and human activity cycles before a facility was categorised as either 'dirty' or 'clean'. Results: Human activity cycles also referred to as socio-economic seasons were, school days, holidays, weekends and market days. These have been called 'impure' seasons, while the 'pure' seasons were the wet and dry months: improved and unimproved facilities were negatively affected by the wet seasons and the peak seasons of human activity. Wet seasons were associated with, mud and stagnant water, flooding pits and a repugnant smell from the latrine cubicle which made cleaning difficult. During the dry season, latrines became relatively cleaner than during the wet season. The presence of many child(ren) users during school days as well as the influx of market goers for the roadside weekly markets compromised the cleaning outcomes for these shared sanitation facilities. Conclusion: Shared latrine cleaning in slums is impacted by seasonal variations related to weather conditions and human activity. The wet seasons made the already bad sanitation situation worse. The seasonal fluctuations in the state of shared slum sanitation relate to a wider malaise in the population and an implied capacity deficit among urban authorities. Poor sanitation in slums is part of a broader urban mismanagement conundrum pointing towards the urgent need for multiple interventions aimed at improving the general urban living conditions well beyond sanitation.","funding":"ETH-Z under the SPLASH project; Kyambogo University","cited":47,"publisher":"BIOMED CENTRAL LTD","year":2016,"volume":"16","pages":10},{"authors":"Viratkapan, V; Perera, R","title":"Slum relocation projects in Bangkok: what has contributed to their success or failure?","source":"HABITAT INTERNATIONAL","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"Many slum relocation projects have been implemented in Bangkok during the last three decades.

In recent years, extreme flood events affected millions of people, disrupting the economic recovery process that followed the peace agreement in 1992. Despite this natural threat, most of the population continues to live in flood prone areas both in rural environment, due to the dependency on agricultural activities, and in urban environment, since unsafe zones ore often the only affordable option for new settlers. This paper presents a brief analytical review on different issues related with urban informal settlements, or slums, based on different project activities developed by the United Notions Human Settlements Programme (UN-HABITAT) in Mozambique. The aim is to identify applicable strategies to reduce vulnerability in urban slums, where approximately 70 percent of the urban population live. The implemented project activities target different organisational levels in on integrated manner, seeking for active involvement of the Government, local authorities and communities at each implementation stage, from decision-making to practical implementation. They consist of three main components: 7) supporting policy-making in order to ensure sustainable urban development, 2) delivering a comprehensive training and capacity building based on the mainstreaming concept of Learning How to Live with Floods as valid alternative to resettlement, and 3) facilitating participatory land use planning coupled with physical upgrading interventions of the local level. In the long-term, the intention of UN-HABITAT is to progressively focus on community-based slum upgrading and vulnerability reduction activities, coordinated by local authorities and actively monitored by central institutions, in improving and managing basic services and infrastructures (i.e. water supply, drainage, sanitation, waste management, rood network, etc). This type of bottom-up experiences should then represent a basis for setting up a slum upgrading intervention strategy to be applied at the national level.","cited":15,"publisher":"OPEN HOUSE INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION","year":2006,"volume":"31","issue":"1","pages":10},{"authors":"Fox, Sean","title":"The Political Economy of Slums: Theory and Evidence from Sub-Saharan Africa","source":"WORLD DEVELOPMENT","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"Over 800 million people in Africa, Asia, and Latin America live in slums.

Slum residents are more vulnerable to TB due to a variety of factors, including their overcrowded living conditions, substandard infrastructure, and limited access to healthcare compared to their non-slum dwelling counterparts. Directly observed treatment (DOT) has been suggested to improve TB treatment outcomes among vulnerable populations, but the program's differential effectiveness among urban slum and non-slum residents is not known. Methods: We retrospectively compared the impact of DOT on TB treatment outcome in residents of slum and non-slum census tracts in Rio de Janeiro reported to the Brazilian Notifiable Disease Database in 2010. Patient residential addresses were geocoded to census tracts from the 2010 Brazilian Census, which were identified as slum (aglomerados subnormais -AGSN) and non-slum (non-AGSN) by the Census Bureau. Homeless and incarcerated cases as well as those geocoded outside the city's limits were excluded from analysis. Results: In 2010, 6,601 TB cases were geocoded within Rio de Janeiro; 1,874 (27.4 %) were residents of AGSN, and 4,794 (72.6 %) did not reside in an AGSN area. DOT coverage among AGSN cases was 35.2 % (n = 638), while the coverage in non-AGSN cases was 26.2 % (n = 1,234). Clinical characteristics, treatment, follow-up, cure, death and abandonment were similar in both AGSN and non-AGSN TB patients.

Conclusion: While DOT coverage was low among TB cases in both AGSN and non-AGSN communities, it had a greater impact on TB cure rate in AGSN than in non-AGSN populations in the city of Rio de Janeiro.","funding":"US Student Fulbright Program; NIH - Fogarty International CenterUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Fogarty International Center (FIC) [R25 TW009338]; Office of AIDS Research at the National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH/USAUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [U2RTW006885 ICOHRTA]; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq) of BrazilConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ); FOGARTY INTERNATIONAL CENTERUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Fogarty International Center (FIC) [R25TW009338, U2RTW006885] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","cited":18,"publisher":"BMC","year":2016,"volume":"16","pages":7},{"authors":"Bennett, Rachel; Chepngeno-Langat, Gloria; Evandrou, Maria; Falkingham, Jane","title":"Gender differentials and old age survival in the Nairobi slums, Kenya","source":"SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"This paper examines gender differentials in survival amongst older people (50+ years) in the Nairobi slums and to the best of our knowledge is the first study of its kind in an urban African setting. The results provide evidence contrary to the expected paradox of poorer self-rated health yet better survival amongst older women. Older women in the Nairobi slums have poorer self-rated health and poorer circumstances across other factors, including disability and socio-economic status. Further, older women in the slums do not have better survival. The conventional female advantage in mortality only becomes apparent after accounting for the cumulative influence of individual characteristics, social networks, health and socio-economic status, suggesting the female advantage in unadjusted old-age mortality does not apply to contexts where women experience significant disadvantage across multiple life domains. This highlights the urgent need to redress the support, status and opportunities available for women across the life course in contexts such as the Nairobi slums.

They pose major challenges in developing countries. During the execution of slum rehabilitation projects, resident families experience significant social and economic disruptions. A scan of extant literature reveals that most of the studies on slum reconstruction, in India, are conducted in the socio-economic and design issues. These studies are focused primarily on the evolution of slums, and the social, health, economic, infrastructure, inequality, layout and design aspects of slums. Existing literature has not revealed project management aspects of slum reconstruction projects particularly the delays that occur during the construction phase of the project. For the purpose of this study, six slum rehabilitation projects have been selected, located in the urbanized western region of India. Using the Relative Importance Index (RII) and the Importance Index (IMPI) as tools to analyse the data, key factors responsible for delays have emerged. These point directly to the issue of non-application of scientific project management techniques for these projects. Furthermore, two-step cluster analysis has been used to check the most significant predictor and to validate the findings of RII and IMPI. The findings of the study concluded that the most significant factors causing delays in slum rehabilitation projects in the four-phase of project life cycle are 'source of financing' in initiation stage, 'project scope' in planning stage, 'managing working capital' in execution stage, and 'the snag list issues related to quality not being addressed' in the close-out stage. The findings of the study are important in understanding the dominant causes for delays in slum rehabilitation projects, and to a considerable extent can be globalized, especially in countries with dense populations.","cited":40,"publisher":"TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","year":2021,"volume":"21","issue":"5","pages":16},{"authors":"Duerr, Eveline","title":"Urban Poverty, Spatial Representation and Mobility: Touring a Slum in Mexico","source":"INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF URBAN AND REGIONAL RESEARCH","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"This article draws attention to a controversial activity in poor urban neighborhoods.

Such material evidence and its often uncertain relationships to other historical data can enhance analysis by complicating understanding of the past, rather than echoing conventional wisdom. Findings from Hungate can thus contribute to nuanced understandings of urban social disadvantage not only at the neighborhood level in this one particular British city, but at the larger scales of analysis that encompass the growth of cities and interacting urban regions in Britain and around the world during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.

It reflects on the Egyptian initiative, started at the outset of 2009, to solve the problematic issue of defining what are called 'slums', or 'informal settlements', or 'Ashwa'iyyat', by replacing them with two distinctive terms; 'unplanned areas' and 'unsafe areas'. This approach is considered to underpin the identification of priorities for intervention and drawing up policies and strategies for improving slums' conditions and the lives of their inhabitants. The paper sheds light on the findings from a survey carried out by the Informal Settlement Development Facility (ISDF) in the period from February to May 2009. This attempted, for the first time to identify unsafe and unplanned areas spatially in all the urban centres in Egypt and classify the former according to degrees of risk based on certain criteria set by the ISDF. The results show substantial discrepancies between previous statistics concerning the size of slums and the more recently produced ones. Areas which are considered unsafe are estimated to contain 1.1 million inhabitants, represents the number of people in great need of immediate action to improve their living conditions.

It describes a physically impoverished environment in which malnutrition is serious, and non-trivial morbid episodes as a consequence of childbirth are very common. Malnutrition was found to be widespread: about one-quarter of the study mothers were short in stature, measuring 145 cm or less in height; over two-thirds of the women weighed <45 kg; and a similar proportion had a BMI of < 20. Based on mid-upper arm circumference, an overwhelming majority (96%) suffered from some degree of malnutrition. During the first 6 weeks postpartum over three-quarters of the women reported a non-trivial illness. The frequency of reported illnesses was significantly associated with both increasing age and parity. Despite severe poverty, most of the women reporting illnesses (71%) received some form of health care from a wide range of western and traditional health care providers, with Traditional Birth Attendants (TBAs) and unqualified western care providers being the most frequently utilised. This study highlights the plight of these women in a precarious environment and shows how their health is compromised by cultural and political constraints. We conclude that while the burden of postpartum morbidity is very high, the incorporation of traditional practitioners and unqualified western care providers into maternal health training programs, together with efforts to empower women, could be effective in improving the health status of mothers in this marginalised and fragmented community. To achieve this outcome, a clearly articulated and integrated approach to development in slum communities is required. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

In developing countries, this process is often accompanied by the formation and expansion of slums. A variety of slum upgrading projects have been implemented to improve the living conditions of slum dwellers however a wide study to investigate the objectives of slum upgrading projects highlighted that environmental features were of low priority compared to basic services and infrastructure. The paper deduces this to be a result of the dominance of UN's household-based definition of slums which lacks emphasis on the locational aspects. An aerial analysis of slums located near waterbodies emphasised the slums' dynamic nature brought about by location and therefore the importance of location itself. Taking cue from this, the paper recommends upgrading projects to be more location-specific that offer flexible yet customised solutions that build upon local knowledge to account for the dynamic and diverse nature of slums. Another inference from the study was that for various reasons one of which is hazardous location slums are perceived to be temporary and as a result, there is low incentive to invest in slums. Such a perception prohibits slum upgrading and pushes them into a negative spiral. Concluding that slums are, however, permanent features in the urban landscape, the paper recommends a change in perception and urges practitioners to accept this permanent nature of slums.

The presence of slum as a part of urban habitat refers to a condition of defective physical, social and economic environment. During last two decades; migration from villages and small towns to metropolitan areas has increased. This leads to the degradation of urban environmental quality and sustainable development especially in the metropolitan cities. The problems faced by the people living in the urban areas have become major concerns for the government. Slums are considered to be the major issue within many urban areas; particularly problems related to transportation, population, health and safety. The Egyptian government has adopted a range of policies and legislation to slow or halt the growth of informal settlements, but successes in improving or removing informal areas have been limited to specific communities and have done nothing to reduce the overall growth of informal areas. The present study is for two slum areas. One is of Egypt (Ezbet Aljama, Alexandria) and the other in India (Dharavi, Mumbai). Since all the slums are not lying at same level of infrastructural development, it is necessary to know about the basic services and facilities like drinking water, electricity, sanitation, education and health services etc between and within the two slums. Therefore, this study was stresses to compare the living conditions and variation between the two slums.

Methods: The population-based study was conducted in seven wards of Mumbai urban slums, where we screened 6569 subjects of >= 40 years age, with a response rate of 98.4%, for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) based on American Diabetes Association criteria. All subjects with T2DM underwent dilated 30 degrees seven-field stereo-fundus-photography for DR severity grading based on modified Airlie House classification. A multivariate logistic regression model was used to assess the correlation of DR with the history-based risk factors. Results: The prevalence of DR in the general population of Mumbai urban slums was 1.41% (95% CI 0.59-2.23) and in the T2DM population it was 15.37% (95% CI 8.87-21.87). The positive associations with DR were the longer duration of DM (>= 11 years: OR, 12.77; 95% CI 2.93-55.61) and male gender (OR, 2.05; 95% CI 1.08-3.89); increasing severity of retinopathy was also significantly associated with longer duration of DM (p < 0.001). However, history of hypertension, family history of DM, consanguineous marriage and migration status were not associated with DR in the study population. Conclusions: The prevalence of DR in the general population and T2DM subjects were 1.41% and 15.37% respectively in Mumbai urban slums. Duration of DM and male gender were significantly associated with DR. The slums in Western India show the trends of urban lifestyle influences similar to the rest of urban India.","funding":"World Diabetes Foundation [WDF08-338]","cited":43,"publisher":"TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC","year":2017,"volume":"24","issue":"5","pages":8},{"authors":"Kohli, Divyani; Warwadekar, Pankaj; Kerle, Norman; Sliuzas, Richard; Stein, Alfred","title":"Transferability of Object-Oriented Image Analysis Methods for Slum Identification","source":"REMOTE SENSING","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"Updated spatial information on the dynamics of slums can be helpful to measure and evaluate progress of policies.

Few comprehensive surveys of adolescents living in Bangkok slums are available in the literature. To appropriately consider adolescents' development in urban planning strategies calls for the study of the relationship between depression and quality of life (QoL) of adolescents in slums. This study aimed to assess the level of depression and to describe the relationship between depression and QoL for the adolescents in a slum community of Bangkok. Methods: This is a descriptive study. Data from eight hundred and seventy-one adolescents in a Bangkok slum community were randomly collected by a survey that utilized a socio-demographic questionnaire, the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D) scale for depression level, and the World Health Organization Quality of Life Brief (WHOQoL-BREF) assessment, Thai version, for quality of life. Results: Thirty-four point nine percent of all respondents exhibited depressive symptoms: 27.6% of males and 40.4% of females. Twenty-six percent of adolescents indicated that they had a poor' quality of life.

This belief/ assumption is often because of their physical proximity and assumed better access to health care services in urban areas. However, a few recent studies have cast doubt on this belief. Whether slum dwellers are better off, similar to, or worse off as compared with rural and other urban populations remain poorly understood as indicators for slum dwellers are generally hidden in urban averages. Objective: The aim of this study was to compare health and health-related indicators among slum, rural, and other urban populations in four countries where specific efforts have been made to generate health indicators specific to slum populations. Design: We conducted a comparative analysis of health indicators among slums, non-slums, and all urban and rural populations as well as national averages in Bangladesh, Kenya, Egypt, and India. We triangulated data from demographic and health surveys, urban health surveys, and special cross-sectional slum surveys in these countries to assess differences in health indicators across the residential domains. We focused the comparisons on child health, maternal health, reproductive health, access to health services, and HIV/AIDS indicators. Within each country, we compared indicators for slums with non-slum, city/urban averages, rural, and national indicators. Between-country differences were also highlighted. Results: In all the countries, except India, slum children had much poorer health outcomes than children in all other residential domains, including those in rural areas. Childhood illnesses and malnutrition were higher among children living in slum communities compared to those living elsewhere. Although treatment seeking was better among slum children as compared with those in rural areas, this did not translate to better mortality outcomes. They bear a disproportionately much higher mortality burden than those living elsewhere. Slum communities had higher coverage of maternal health services than rural communities but it was not possible to comparematernal mortality rates across these residential domains. Compared to rural areas, slum communities had lower fertility and higher contraceptive use rates but these differences were reversed when slums were compared to other urban populations. Slum-rural differences in infant mortality were found to be larger in Bangladesh compared to Kenya. Conclusion: Mortality and morbidity indicators were worse in slums than elsewhere. However, indicators of access to care and health service coverage were found to be better in slums than in rural communities.","cited":35,"publisher":"TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","year":2016,"volume":"9","pages":13},{"authors":"Mahabir, Ron; Agouris, Peggy; Stefanidis, Anthony; Croitoru, Arie; Crooks, Andrew T.","title":"Detecting and mapping slums using open data: a case study in Kenya","source":"INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"The worldwide slum population currently stands at over one billion, with substantial growth expected in the coming decades.

To overcome such issues, this paper explores the fusion of traditional with emerging open data sources and data mining tools to identify additional indicators that can be used to detect and map the presence of slums, map their footprint, and map their evolution. Towards this goal, we develop an indicator database for slums using open sources of physical and socio-economic data that can be used to characterize slum settlements. Using this database, we then leverage data mining techniques to identify the most suitable combination of these indicators for mapping slums.

Despite ( inter) national efforts, slum sanitation provision remains inadequate and the projected population growth forecasts a worsening of this crisis. The core of the problem is that available knowledge about the local feasibility of the currently applied sanitary methods is limited. This paper analyses the interface of sanitation policy and technology domains by reviewing the distribution and local characteristics of current centralized and decentralized sanitation options. The findings confirm that conventional, centralized sanitation is an unrealistic solution for application in slums. Simplified sewerage may prove appropriate, but the reported initiatives are in the planning phase only. At present, only decentralized sanitation options are found to be viable in the assessed slums, but their servicing is increasingly neglected by the municipal authorities. The quasi-monopoly of pit latrines implies that improved sanitation technologies are not sufficiently rooted yet. Public toilets are crucial to these slums, especially where land tenure issues prevail. Although the potential of ecological sanitation is currently negligible, novel biocenter initiatives are promising. Municipal authorities are advised to prioritize the implementation of elsewhere successful slum sanitation technologies and to integrate appropriate decentral solutions into their predominantly centralized sanitation schemes.","funding":"Wageningen UniversityEuropean Commission","cited":56,"publisher":"IWA PUBLISHING","year":2012,"volume":"14","issue":"4","pages":12},{"authors":"HARPHAM, T; STEPHENS, C","title":"POLICY DIRECTIONS IN URBAN HEALTH IN DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES - THE SLUM IMPROVEMENT APPROACH","source":"SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"The urban development, or housing, sector has a longer experience of addressing the problems of the urban poor in developing countries than the health sector.

This has compounded the vulnerability and exposure ofresidents in these slums to disasters, especially as an outcome of exposure to hazards. Amongst the most vulnerable are women, typically lying near the bottom of not just the poverty or wealth index, but in nearly every index of human development, giving rise to feminisation of poverty. An increased frequency of disasters, coupled with multidimensional vulnerabilities, high probability of exposure and compromised capacities places the women highest in the risk profile for disasters also. The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (SFDRR) has shifted focus from disaster management to disaster risk management (DRM) by setting goals for both, preventing new and reducing existing disaster risks, by strengthening community resilience through socio-economic and other development measures. Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) aim to leave no one behind in enhancing capacities of individuals and communities through development. In this context, understanding the vulnerabilities and associated risks for women, especially those who are in urban slums which have so far been treated by policy makers as an amorphous mass within the greater urban world, becomes critical. Gender vulnerability in a disaster-risk context directly links to pre-existing vulnerabilities within the society as being outcomes of skewed development processes, poverty, construed status of women and rapid urbanisation. In order to empower these women effectively, it is critical to understand the pre-existing vulnerabilities, or vulnerability bundles, and address them by focusing on reducing the risks they generate with reference to the four priority areas of the SFDRR. An analysis using five dimensions of vulnerability that has been recognised through research over the years, substantiates that women in urban slums are more susceptible to being affected by disasters as an outcome of the daily challenges that they face. Some of these challenges include patriarchal society, sociocultural and religious beliefs, gender stereotyping, insecure livelihoods, non-availability of services such as WASH, health and education, sexual abuse and violence, and a lack of legal identity. Disaster risk reduction measures for women living in slums should aim to minimise risks for them, while enhancing their resilience by reducing vulnerabilities and increasing capacities, by working through the socioeconomic systems within their circumstances. Therefore, emphasis has to be on un-skewing development by making it risk-based, inclusive and comprehensive towards reducing vulnerabilities of the women in urban slums. There should also be efforts towards enhancing their coping capacities, which, like vulnerability, needs management through the development portfolio. Increasing resilience can be incremental through radical policies and targeted development through the portfolio of SDGs, leading to greater investment in slums through public works.","cited":87,"publisher":"ELSEVIER","year":2021,"volume":"60","pages":12},{"authors":"Datta, Ayona","title":"The intimate city: violence, gender and ordinary life in Delhi slums","source":"URBAN GEOGRAPHY","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"In this paper I argue for an expansion of the horizons of urban geography through a notion of the intimate city.

Methods: Using a cross-sectional survey conducted between August 2011-February 2012, we explored disclosure of violence, help seeking behavior, and their correlates among randomly selected currently married women aged 15-29 in Dhaka slums (n = 2604). Results: About 60 % of the currently married women reported past year spousal physical violence, but only 21 % disclosed and 19 % sought any help. High acceptance of violence was the main reason for not seeking help. Help was most commonly sought from informal sources (89 %). Any education, frequent and severe physical abuse, and presence of children increased the likelihood of disclosure and help seeking. Most survivors from slum who disclosed also sought help. Conclusions: Despite widespread physical abuse, many survivors never sought help. Wide acceptance of violence hampering help seeking needs to be challenged. Increasing disclosure would also enhance help seeking. Awareness rising regarding rights of women to live a violence free life is essential. Although many services are available in the urban area, information about these services needs to be available to women.

Comparisons of the correlations of the screening tests with the neuropsychological measures indicated that the SLUMS demonstrated stronger relationships with the TMT compared with the MMSE. Multiple regression analyses were conducted to determine the ability of the SLUMS and the MMSE to predict scores on common neuropsychological tests after controlling for demographic variables. Results demonstrated that the SLUMS significantly predicted performance across all measures over the MMSE and demographic variables, with the exception of the WCST's perseverative errors. However, the MMSE does not add to the prediction of neuropsychological functioning over the SLUMS. Conclusion: Although the SLUMS and the MMSE are strongly correlated, the SLUMS significantly adds to the prediction of neuropsychological measures beyond the MMSE scores. Our findings suggest that the SLUMS may be an appropriate measure to use as a screening tool among older adults and may have fewer ceiling effects than the MMSE.","cited":26,"publisher":"ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC","year":2013,"volume":"21","issue":"7","pages":8},{"authors":"Hossain, Khandker Zakir; Ahmed, Shafiul Azam","title":"Non-conventional public-private partnerships for water supply to urban slums","source":"URBAN WATER JOURNAL","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"Slums are a common feature in developing countries.

Past trends show correlations between urban growth and slum growth, thereby creating a major challenge for sustainable city planning. This study explores the drivers of slum development in Lagos, and simulates scenarios for slum growth through coupling logistic regression with the cellular automata-based SLEUTH model. RapidEye (2009 and 2015) and Sentinel-2 (2015) imagery were used to create slum extents maps for each time point, and then used for the calibration and prediction, respectively, of the model. The driving forces of slum development in Lagos were analyzed, and the correlated spatial drivers compiled to create a probability map of slum development using the logistic regression model. The probability map was incorporated with the exclusion layer of the modified SLEUTH to simulate scenarios of slum growth in Lagos by 2035. Three scenarios were designed based on the modification of the exclusion layer and the transition rules. The Scenario 1 'business as usual', depicts slum development following the present trend; the scenario 2 'excessive growth', considers the demographic projection for the city; while the scenario 3 'limited government influence', asserts limited interference by the government in slum management/control. Factors including distance to markets, distance to shoreline, distance to local government administrative buildings, land prices, etc. were predictors of slum development in Lagos. The prediction model, based on the logistic regression, reached an overall accuracy of 79.17% and a relative operation characteristics value of 0.85. The three scenarios show further densification of the existing slums, and increase in their area by 1.18 km(2) (scenario 1), 4.02 km(2) (scenario 2), and 1.28 km(2) (scenario 3). New slums are predicted at the fringe of the south-eastern part of the city. The foreseen limited spatial growth of the slums is due to the high density of the city, thus new slums may likely develop in the neighboring zones to Lagos when land in the city is no longer available.","funding":"Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst (DAAD)Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD)","cited":84,"publisher":"ELSEVIER SCI LTD","year":2019,"volume":"77","pages":13},{"authors":"Oppong, Joseph R.; Mayer, Jonathan; Oren, Eyal","title":"The global health threat of African urban slums: the example of urban tuberculosis","source":"AFRICAN GEOGRAPHICAL REVIEW","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"Urban slums in developing countries are experiencing the most rapid population growth of any settlement type globally. Such growth of densely settled slums exerts a profound influence on the epidemiology and geography of communicable disease, transmitted through multiple modes. Specifically, high density, poor sanitation, poorly built housing, and lack of both adequate sewage systems and water supply facilitate pathogen spread. Long-range transmission of infection, partly through migration or travel of infected individuals, makes communicable diseases of urban areas in developing countries health problems of the entire world rather than localized areas. Non-endemic areas are threatened with disease spread. Because a significant proportion of slum growth and disease burden is in sub-Saharan Africa, global well-being demands that we understand and control disease spread in African slums as a major international health priority. This paper outlines the potential threats and implications of African urban slum health using the example of tuberculosis (TB), which is highly prevalent in developing countries.

Data were collected primarily by interviews and observations as well as secondary data collection with literature review. Data were analyzed descriptively and supplemented by triangulation. The result shows that land ownership status for low-income people is not a top priority. They prefer living close to their livelihoods, ignoring their land ownership status, making it difficult for the government to handle slum settlements. Moreover, there is a policy gap that resulted in the lack of strong legal basis in handling slum settlements in DKI Jakarta. The socio-cultural-economic-environmental approach needs to be applied in overcoming slums on illegal land, by integrating social mapping and land consolidation, which strongly prioritizes cooperation between targeted communities and the political will of the government.

We use these estimates to simulate the impact of alternate interventions on household welfare. We find that households derive benefits from housing quality and neighborhood amenities.

In the case of the other approach, these steps are realized by members of the given community with a facilitator - this is called community planning. This paper compares these two planning approaches using two slum upgrading programs in Kenya as examples, and it aims to use the experiences gained from them to support the hypothesis that the key to efficient slum upgrading is the active involvement of the affected community in the planning process; that is, community planning.","cited":35,"publisher":"REGIONAL SCIENCE ASSOC SUBOTICA, SERBIA","year":2019,"volume":"11","issue":"1","pages":18},{"authors":"Oppong, Benjamin Effah; Asomani-Boateng, Raymond; Fricano, Russell J.","title":"Accra's Old Fadama/Agbogbloshie settlement.

The dynamic development of the city area brings many impacts to the urban community's own life patterns. The development of the city center which is the center of economic activity becomes the attraction for the community that can bring influence to the high flow of labor both from within the city itself and from outside the city area, thus causing the high flow of urbanization. Urbanization has caused an explosion in urban population and one implication is the occurrence of labor-clumping in major cities in Indonesia. Another impact of the high urbanization flow of cities is the problem of urban settlements. The more populations that come in the city, the worse the quality of the existing settlements in the city if not managed properly. This study aims to determine the location of slum areas in East Wara Sub-Districts using remote sensing technology tools and Geographic Information System (GIS). Parameters used to identify slum areas partially extracted using remote sensing data and for parameters that cannot be extracted using remote sensing data, information obtained from field surveys with information retrieval based on reference data. Analysis results for slum settlements taken from the parameters indicate that the East Wara Sub-District has the largest slum areas located in Pontap village. The village of Pontap has two classes of slums that are very shabby and slums. Slum classes are also in Surutangga Village. The result of the analysis shows that the slum settlement area has 46,324 Ha, which is only located in Pontap Village, whereas for the slum class are found in some villages of Pontap and Surutangga Urban Village, there are 37.797 Ha area. The class of slum settlement areas has the largest proportion of the area among other classes in East Wara Subdistrict. The class of slum settlement areas has an area of 74,481 Ha. This class is located in Kelurahan Salekoe and Kelurahan Benteng. The less grungy and quite shabby class is the rest which each has an area of 29,144 Ha and 18,228 Ha.

Considering risk as a function of both heat vulnerability and hazard intensity, this study examines whether poor urban dwellers residing in slums are exposed to higher temperature, adding to their vulnerable demographic and health conditions. Instead of being restricted by sampling size of pixels or other land surface zones, this study follows the intrinsic latent patterns of the heat phenomenon to examine the association between small clusters of slums and heat patterns. Remotely sensed land surface temperature (LST) datasets of moderate resolution are employed to derive the morphological features of the temperature patterns in the city of Ahmedabad, India at the local scale. The optimal representations of temperature pattern morphology are learnt automatically from temporally adjacent images without manually choosing model hyper-parameters. The morphological features are then evaluated to identify the local scale temperature pattern at slum locations. Results show that in particular locations with slums are exposed to a locally high temperature. More specifically, larger slums tend to be exposed to a more intense locally high temperature compared to smaller slums. Due to the small size of slums in Ahmedabad, it is hard to conclude whether slums are impacting the locally high temperature, or slums are more likely to be located in poorly built places already with a locally high temperature. This study complements the missing dimension of hazard investigation to heat-related risk analysis of slums. The study developed a workflow of exploring the temperature patterns at the local scale and examination of heat exposure of slums. It extends the conventional city scale urban temperature analysis into local scales and introduces morphological measurements as new parameters to quantify temperature patterns at a more detailed level.

Areas of recreation, schools, hospitals, government offices and residential quarters were well provided. However, after the Nigeria-Biafra war, the urban planning became bastardized.

This unchecked subsequent development of the city away from its original purview is the crux of this research. This study examines the lived experiences of the people in these slums, the effect on children, the urban city, as well as the challenges posed by climate change. Investigations revealed a paradigm shift in the popular narratives that poverty, cheap house rents, unemployment and low-income earning are the reasons a large number of people live in slums. The findings from the study were drawn through the use of the qualitative and quantitative method of historical inquiry while Onitsha served as the study area, as the study strived to address the unsustainable urban development in Nigeria.

To mitigate risks of transmission, and alleviate economic distress associated with containment measures, public health experts and international agencies are calling for community-driven solutions that harness local participation.

How are slum leaders positioned to address the health and livelihood threats of the pandemic within their neighborhoods? What problem-solving activities, if any, have they performed for residents during the pandemic? What factors shape success in those efforts? To answer these questions, we conducted a phone survey of 321 slum leaders across 79 slum settlements in two north Indian cities. The survey was conducted in April and May 2020, at the height of India's stringent national lockdown in response to the virus. Our survey reveals striking continuities with pre pandemic politics. First, slum leaders persist in their problem-solving roles, even as they shift their efforts towards requesting urgently needed government relief (particularly food rations). Second, slum leaders vary in their reported ability to gather information about relief schemes, make claims, and command government responsiveness. The factors that inform the effectiveness of slum leaders during 'normal times', notably their education and degree of embeddedness in party networks, continue to do so during the lockdown. Slum leader reliance on partisan networks raises concerns regarding the inclusiveness of their efforts. Finally, slums are not uniformly challenged in maintaining social distancing. Pre-pandemic disparities in infrastructural development fragment the degree to which residents must depart from social distancing guidelines to secure essential services. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Four electronic databases were searched for studies published between 1993 and 2017, with TB defined as at least one sputum smear-positive. The review followed the PRISMA protocol and information was extracted from articles for a full-text review to determine eligibility. Odds ratios were calculated for studies reporting sputum smear-positive TB cases in slum settings with national incidence as a comparison. Summary estimates were calculated using the random effects model (95% CI) and publication bias was assessed through funnel plot analysis. A quality assessment of included articles was also conducted. This meta-analysis was conducted across three categories: (1) across all 22 studies, (2) studies utilizing Active Case Finding, and (3) studies conducted in a high TB-HIV setting. The odds of sputum smear-positive TB were significantly higher across all three categories of analysis. Compared with national TB incidence rates, the combined odds ratio of smear-positive TB within slums was 2.96 (2.84, 3.09; p<0.01). The combined odds ratio for smear-positive TB with active case finding across 15 studies was 2.85 (2.71, 2.99; p<0.01).

What are the conditions under which they can accept slum tourism? Design/methodology/approach - The foundation of this paper was laid during a field trip to Medellin, Colombia, in March 2018. More than three weeks were spent in the neighbourhood of Moravia, one of Medellin's barrios or slums, where a qualitative study was led. Semi-structured interviews with the local community were done around the neighbourhood. Findings - The main finding of this research is the positive perception of slum tourism within the Moravia community. The researchers found that the locals are proud when outsiders visit to see their neighbourhood. The locals felt that, it breaks the prejudice surrounding their homes, and tourists are seen as spokespeople for the barrio. There are visible improvements made to the barrio owing to tourism. This research drew attention to the conditions under which this type of tourism can be accepted in the neighbourhood: community participation, interaction between hosts and tourists, education and respect of tourists and the visible improvements to the neighbourhood. Originality/value - Slum tourism is an understudied topic in Colombia, especially in Medellin.

They are products of unplanned urbanization and poverty. Traditionally, interventionary approaches to the mitigation of infrastructural and environmental problems of slums have been based on paternalistic approaches which concentrate more on infrastructure and amenity provision, neighbourhood improvement, and the rehabilitation of homes. Rarely are the priorities and peculiar preferences of the slum dwellers accorded adequate attention for the purpose of prioritizing ameliorative efforts. Even in cases where grassroots participation is encouraged, their priorities may not be given adequate opportunity to be articulated in a manner that will be translated into final action. As a first step towards sustainability, slum eradication guidelines should more dynamically address the issue of the livelihoods of the dwellers in order to attain proper planning and development. In this regard, infrastructure and amenity preferences with respect to income generation and social welfare of slum residents should be explored. This study investigates slum dwellers' value of location-based amenities and infrastructure in Makoko, a slum in Lagos State, using both descriptive and inferential statistics. The paper reveals primarily those infrastructure and amenity needs that are linked with income generation. These are found to be not necessarily in accordance with more generalized rankings. The application of this survey will serve as a guide for public investment decision and poverty eradication.","cited":31,"publisher":"HONG KONG POLYTECHNIC UNIV, FAC CONSTRUCTION & ENVIRONMENT","year":2010,"pages":10},{"authors":"Roy, Debraj; Lees, Michael Harold; Pfeffer, Karin; Sloot, Peter M.

Traditionally, policy makers have concentrated on population control strategies by focussing on birth rates and rural-urban migration to stem the growth and emergence of slums. However, these strategies have often failed to achieve the desired results. In the present paper we find the key underlying processes that explains the observed differences in household life cycle between slum and non-slum households. We find that the slum households when compared to nonslum urban households, exhibit a large variation in the household size over the course of their life cycle, which in turn leads to inefficiency while building slum resettlement colonies. We have developed an agent based model, namely DynaSlum, to identify the key social determinants that impact the behaviour of a slum household. We use a novel and unique dataset based on the field work from 37 slums in Bangalore combined with the NFHS data to calibrate DynaSlum and validate our findings. This paper presents two major insights to address the challenges. First, we find that high rate of home leaving among young adults is the key determinants for the large variation in the life cycle of slum households. Second, we show that reducing home leaving among young adults will reduce the formation number of new slum households and contribute to a higher but stable household size. This will lead to efficiency and higher per capita resource consumption when building capacity for slum development (resettlement colonies) as policy makers would be able to plan for a stable household size.

Under the impetus of global change processes and consequent transformations at the environmental, social, cultural, political and economical scales; factors causing disasters and losses are changing every day. These changes are also altering society's ability to respond to hazard events. This paper examines the response of slum dwellers who are the most vulnerable and marginal section of urban population and often located in places with high hazard risk with less or no means to reduce the impact of flood events. Marginal population groups in megacities suffer the negative consequences of large scale global change processes and do not benefit from the risk mitigation strategies adopted by city authorities. The paper therefore argues that people living in informal settlements instead have to employ a combination of structural means and complex networks of assistance to recover from floods. Based on the results deduced from data collected with the help of household surveys in the slums of Mumbai, the study demonstrates the types of coping strategies used by slum dwellers and the changing characteristics of these mechanisms under the influence of global change processes in megacities. Furthermore, results show that capacity to respond is not equally distributed among slum dwellers due to underlying socio cultural divisions and emerging economic and political constraints. The paper concludes that to address existing discrepancies in urban societies and within slum settlements, flood mitigation strategies will have to be (1) more inclusive of marginal population (2) sensitive to the limitations and scope of old and new social structures and (3) incorporate innovative networks of support to deal with the consequences of global change.","cited":67,"publisher":"SPRINGER","year":2010,"volume":"15","issue":"4","pages":17},{"authors":"Muchadenyika, Davison; Waiswa, Jeremy","title":"Policy, politics and leadership in slum upgrading: A comparative analysis of Harare and Kampala","source":"CITIES","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"Slum upgrading is one of the preferred options in dealing with ubiquitous informality in cities across the world.

When the primary earner of a slum household suffers from occupational illness and injuries, without insurance coverage or partial coverage of insurance, this boon may become a curse in the long run. The occupational security and safety along with the fact that whether such workers are insured is an important aspect and has a close link with the expenditure on illness. Thus, the accessibility to employees' insurance in the risky industrial occupation, particularly for slum dwellers, is crucial to protect them from falling into poverty. Studies on occupational health of the poor workers are either limited to informal sectors or remain industry specific and the analysis of their accessibility to job insurance is rarely done. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach The research questions are framed to analyze the types of insurance accessible to workers across various industries; the accessibility to insurance, however, varying across risk intensities of various industries; and the determinants of insurance accessibility of the industrial workers living in slums. The determinants of accessibility of job insurance are analyzed with a binary Logit model. A multi-stage random sampling technique is used to collect the primary data from 320 industrial workers living in the slums of the Indian state of West Bengal. Findings The industrial workers, irrespective of the types of industries, are exposed to a high-risk category without proper job insurance. The higher industrial income is not adequate to prevent financial hardships. Access to insurance is more likely for the respondents with job tenure of more than two years and less likely for the workers who are working for more than eight hours per day.

Best window size was found using a spatial neighborhood of 81 x 81 pixels resulting in Overall Accuracy of 88.58 and Kappa of 0.7809 for RF classifier. A patch-based analysis of classification results reveals areal dependencies of the classifier in terms of larger slum patches that are mapped with higher precision than smaller patches.

The Social Determinants of Health (SDH) framework has been used to understand the social dynamics and impact of NCDs, especially in poorly resourced communities. Whilst the SDH has helped to discredit the characterisation of NCDs as diseases of affluence, its impact on policy has been less definite. Given the multitude of factors that interact in the presentation of NCDs, operationalising the SDH for policies and programmes that account for the contextual complexity of slums has stalled. Objective: To organise the complex networks of relations between SDH in slums so as to identify options for Indian municipal policy that are feasible to implement in the short term. Methods: The study reviews the literature describing SDH in Indian slums, specifically those that establish causal relations between SDH and NCDs. Root cause analysis was then used to organise the identified relations of SDH and NCDs. Results: Although poverty remains the largest structural determinant of health in slums, the multi-dimensional relations between SDH and NCDs are structured around four themes that describe the dynamics of slums, namely scarce clean water, low education, physical (in) activity and transportation. From the reviewed literature, four logic trees visualising the relations between SDH in slums and NCDs were constructed. The logic trees separate symptomatic problems from their more distal causes, and recommendations were formulated based on features of these relationships that are amenable to policy intervention. Conclusion: Root cause analysis provides a means to focus the lens of examination of SDH, as evidenced here for Indian slums. It provides a guide for the development of policies that are grounded in the actual health concerns of people in slums, and takes account of the complex pathways through which diseases are socially constituted.","funding":"Erasmus Mundus Joint Doctorate Programme - EACEA (Education, Audiovisual and Culture Executive Agency) [2013-1479]","cited":59,"publisher":"TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","year":2018,"volume":"11","issue":"1","pages":12},{"authors":"Griffin, Tom; Muldoon, Meghan","title":"Exploring virtual reality experiences of slum tourism","source":"TOURISM GEOGRAPHIES","language":"English","doc":"Article; Early Access","abstract":"The popularity of slum tourism has been growing and is a topic of substantial discussion.

The developed rule base allowed the description of knowledge about phenomena clearly and easily using fuzzy membership functions and the described knowledge stored in the classification rule base led to the best classification with more than 80% accuracy.","cited":31,"publisher":"COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH","year":2012,"volume":"39-B8","pages":6},{"authors":"Tumwebaze, Innocent K.; Mosler, Hans-Joachim","title":"Shared toilet users' collective cleaning and determinant factors in Kampala slums, Uganda","source":"BMC PUBLIC HEALTH","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"Background: Dirty shared toilets are a health risk to users in urban slum settlements. For health and non-health benefits among users of shared toilets to be guaranteed, their cleanliness is important. The objective of this study was to investigate the cleanliness situation of shared toilets in Kampala's slums and the psychological and social dilemma factors influencing users' cleaning behaviour and commitment by using the risks, attitudes, norms, ability and self-regulation (RANAS) model and factors derived from the social dilemma theory. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study in three slums of Kampala between December 2012 and January 2013. Data were collected from 424 household respondents that were primarily using shared toilets. Semi-structured questionnaires administered through face-to-face interviews were used in data collection. Linear regression was done for the multivariate analysis to test for the association between respondent cleaning behaviour and a combination of RANAS and social dilemma predictors. Results: Out of 424 respondents interviewed, 44.3% reported cleaning the shared toilet daily, 34.4% cleaned once or several times a week, 1.4% cleaned every second week, 5.4% cleaned once or several times a month and 14.4% did not participate in cleaning. The main RANAS factors significantly associated with respondents' cleaning behaviour were: attitudinal affective belief associated with cleaning a shared toilet (beta = -0.13, P = 0.00) and self-regulating factors, such as coping planning (beta = 0.42, P = 0.00), commitment (beta = 0.24, P = 0.00), and remembering (beta = 0.10, P = 0.01). For social dilemma factors, only the social motive factor was statistically significant (beta = 0.15, P = 0.00). The R square for the linear model on factors influencing cleaning behaviour was 0.77 and R square for factors influencing cleaning commitment was 0.70. Conclusion: The RANAS factors provide a more robust understanding of shared toilet users' cleaning behaviour than social dilemma factors. Self-regulating factors and changing the negative affective cleaning feelings are shown to be very important for interventions to increase shared toilet users' collective participation in their cleaning. In addition to RANAS, social dilemma factors have an important influence on slum residents' commitment to clean their shared toilets.","funding":"Swiss National Centre of Competence in Research North South: Research Partnerships for Mitigating Syndromes of Global Change; Swiss National Science FoundationSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)European Commission; Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation","cited":48,"publisher":"BMC","year":2014,"volume":"14","pages":10},{"authors":"Roy, Ananya","title":"Slum-free cities of the Asian century: Postcolonial government and the project of inclusive growth","source":"SINGAPORE JOURNAL OF TROPICAL GEOGRAPHY","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"The Asian Century can be understood as a historical conjuncture marked by new formations of economic hegemony and bold claims of Asian ascendancy.

Slum-free Cities marks a shift in city-making projects and indeed in the project of modernizationfrom slum evictions and demolitions to the integration of the poor into market rule. This essay provides an analysis of such emerging configurations of state, economy and poverty. Yet, such projects of inclusive growth are marked by paradoxes and limits, notably the complexity of transforming slum lands into legible and monetized property markets. These dilemmas are not new, and in fact, the archives of postcolonial government indicate repeated recitations of slum modernization.

Despite the use of geospatial technologies in planning, the local, state and central governments have only been partially successful in dealing with these problems. The study on existing policies and programmes also proved that when the government is the sole provider or mediator, GIS can become a tool of coercion rather than participatory decision-making. It has also been observed that local level administrators who have adopted Geospatial technology for local planning continue to base decision-making on existing political processes. In this juncture, geospatial decision support system (GSDSS) can provide a framework for integrating database management systems with analytical models, graphical display, tabular reporting capabilities and the expert knowledge of decision makers. This assists decision-makers to generate and evaluate alternative solutions to spatial problems. During this process, decision-makers undertake a process of decision research -producing a large number of possible decision alternatives and provide opportunities to involve the community in decision making. The objective is to help decision makers and planners to find solutions through a quantitative spatial evaluation and verification process.

We use a sequential explanatory design, which is a combination of quantitative and qualitative research, and data are obtained through observation, in-depth interviews, surveys, and documentation. The results showed that slum settlements in watersheds and coastal areas as well as inadequate support for infrastructure services resulted in excessive groundwater use, soil pollution, and surface water quality pollution resulting in less smooth river flow regulation, lowering of water levels, urban flooding, and disease transmission. Weak control over spatial use, utilization of water catchment areas, and the inadequate fulfillment of slum settlement infrastructure services cause a decrease in environmental quality. These results indicate that it is very important to deal with slum settlements in a sustainable manner, including spatial use and environmental, economic, and social aspects.

Wide disparities between urban slums and the rest of the country can potentially push country indicators off track unless the specific health and nutrition needs of the expanding slum communities are addressed. The study aims at describing the individual, household and community determinants of undernutrition status among children living in major urban strata, viz. City Corporation slums and non-slums, in order to understand the major drivers of childhood undernutrition in urban slum settings. Methods: Data are derived from Bangladesh Urban Health Survey conducted in 2013. This survey is a large- scale, nationally representative of urban areas, household survey designed specifically to provide health and nutrition status of women and children in urban Bangladesh. Results: Data showed that 50% of under-5 children in slums are stunted and 43% are underweight, whereas for non-slums these rates are 33 and 26% respectively. In terms of severity, proportion of under-5 children living in slums severely underweight or stunted are nearly double than the children living in non-slums. Logistic analyses indicate that mother's education, child's age, and household's socio-economic status significantly affects stunting and underweight levels among children living in the urban slums. Logistic models also indicate that all individual-level characteristics, except exposure to mass media and mother's working outside home, significantly affect undernutrition levels among children living on non-slums. Among the household-and community-level characteristics, only household's socioeconomic status remains significant for the non-slums. Conclusions: Poor nutritional status is a major concern in slum areas, particularly as this group is expected to grow rapidly in the next few years. The situation calls for specially designed and well targeted interventions that take into account that many of the mothers are poorer and less educated, which affects their ability to provide care to their children.","funding":"United States Agency for International Development, UK Department for International DevelopmentUnited States Agency for International Development (USAID); EUNICE KENNEDY SHRIVER NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF CHILD HEALTH & HUMAN DEVELOPMENTUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD) [R24HD050924, P2CHD050924] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","cited":56,"publisher":"BMC","year":2017,"volume":"75","pages":13},{"authors":"Sarkar, Rajiv; Sivarathinaswamy, Prabhu; Thangaraj, Bhuvaneshwari; Sindhu, Kulandaipalayam Natarajan Chella; Ajjampur, Sitara Swarna Rao; Muliyil, Jayaprakash; Balraj, Vinohar; Naumova, Elena N.; Ward, Honorine; Kang, Gagandeep","title":"Burden of childhood diseases and malnutrition in a semi-urban slum in southern India","source":"BMC PUBLIC HEALTH","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"Background: India has seen rapid unorganized urbanization in the past few decades.

Methods and Results A quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) was carried out to determine the magnitude of microbial risks from waterborne pathogens through various exposure pathways in Bwaise III in Kampala (Uganda). This was based on the concentration of Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella spp., rotavirus (RV) and human adenoviruses F and G (HAdV) in spring water, tap water, surface water, grey water and contaminated soil samples. The total disease burden was 680 disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) per 1000 persons per year. The highest disease burden contribution was caused by exposure to surface water open drainage channels (39%) followed by exposure to grey water in tertiary drains (24%), storage containers (22%), unprotected springs (8%), contaminated soil (7%) and tap water (002%). The highest percentage of the mean estimated infections was caused by E.coli O157:H7 (41%) followed by HAdV (32%), RV (20%) and Salmonella spp. (7%). In addition, the highest infection risk was 1 caused by HAdV in surface water at the slum outlet, while the lowest infection risk was 271x10(-6) caused by E.coli O157:H7 in tap water. Conclusions The results show that the slum environment is polluted, and the disease burden from each of the exposure routes in Bwaise III slum, with the exception of tap water, was much higher than the WHO reference level of tolerable risk of 1x10(-6) DALYs per person per year. Significance and Impact of the Study The findings of this study provide guidance to governments, local authorities and nongovernment organizations in making decisions on measures to reduce infection risk and the disease burden by 10(2) to 10(5) depending on the source of exposure to achieve the desired health impacts. The infection risk may be reduced by sustainable management of human excreta and grey water, coupled with risk communication during hygiene awareness campaigns at household and community level. The data also provide a basis to make strategic investments to improve sanitary conditions in urban slums.","funding":"Netherlands Ministry of Development Cooperation (DGIS) through the UNESCO-IHE Partnership Research Fund","cited":79,"publisher":"WILEY","year":2014,"volume":"116","issue":"2","pages":17},{"authors":"Zain, Dian Purnamasari; Salman, Darmawan; Baja, Sumbangan","title":"Model of Slum Area Management Based on Socio-Spatial Approach.

Approached through a political perspective at a local micro-scale, attempts to control and regulate electricity supply and use in the slum appear to be highly conflictual and reveal considerable power struggles over this marginalized territory.

The resulting actions lead to poor health-seeking behaviour and underutilisation of existing formal health facilities. The ways that slum people use to communicate their feelings about illness, the type of confidants that they choose, and the supportive and unsupportive social and cultural interactions to which they are exposed have not yet been studied in the Indian context, which constitutes an important knowledge gap for Indian policymakers and practitioners alike. To that end, this study examines the patterns of illness disclosure in Indian slums and the underpinning factors which shape the slum dwellers' disclosing attitude. Methods: In-depth, semi-structured interviews were conducted among 105 men and 113 women who experienced illness in the year prior to the study period. Respondents were selected from four urban slums in two Indian cities, Bangalore and Kolkata. Results: Findings indicate that women have more confidants at different social levels, while men have a limited network of disclosures which is culturally and socially mediated. Gender role limitations, exclusion from peer groups and unsupportive local situations are the major cause of disclosure delay or non-disclosure among men, while the main concerns for women are a lack of proper knowledge about illness, unsupportive responses received from other people on certain occasions, the fear of social stigma, material loss and the burden of the local situation. Prompt sharing of illness among men is linked with prevention intention and coping with biological problems, whereas factors determining disclosure for women relate to ensuring emotional and instrumental safety, preventing collateral damage of illness, and preventing and managing biological complications. Conclusions: The findings reveal that patterns of disclosure are not determined by the acknowledgment of illness but largely depend on the interplay between individual agency, disclosure consequences and the socio cultural environment. The results of this study can contribute significantly to mitigating the pivotal knowledge gap between health policymakers, practitioners and patients, leading to the formulation of policies that maximise the utilisation of health facilities in slums.","cited":57,"publisher":"BMC","year":2018,"volume":"18","pages":17},{"authors":"Sarrica, Mauro; Rega, Isabella; Inversini, Alessandro; Norton, Laura Soledad","title":"Slumming on Social Media?

Methods: We conducted a household survey of pneumococcal carriage among residents of a slum community in the city of Salvador, Brazil. Results: Among 262 subjects, 95 (36%) were colonized with Streptococcus pneumoniae. Children < 5 years of age (OR, 8.0; 95% CI, 3.5-18.6) and those who attended schools (OR, 2.7, 95% CI, 1.2-6.0) had significantly higher risk of being colonized. Of 94 isolates obtained from colonized individuals, 51 % had serotypes included in the seven-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. Overall, 10% (9 of 94 isolates) were nonsusceptible to penicillin and 28% (27 of 94 isolates) were resistant to cotrimoxazole. BOX-PCR, PFGE and MLST analyses found that 44% of the carriage isolates belonged to 14 distinct clonal groups. Strains of the same clonal group were isolated from multiple members of 9 out of the 39 study households. Nineteen carriage isolates had genotypes that were the same as those identified among 362 strains obtained from active surveillance for meningitis. Conclusions: The study's findings indicate that there is significant intra- and inter-household spread of S. pneumoniae in the slum community setting.

To compare Polish version of the The Saint Louis University Mental Status Examination test (SLUMS) to generally used psychometric screening tools for detecting mild cognitive impairment and dementia. Methods. The total number of 58 nursing home residents were divided into 3 groups: 1) people showing no symptoms of dementia, 2) people with mild cognitive impairment and 3) people with suspected dementia. The Saint Louis University Mental Status Examination (SLUMS), Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), Short Test of Mental State (STMS) and Test Your Memory (TYM) were administered for comparison. Results. Mean age was 81.7 +/- 8.62. Regarding the education, 37.9% of the sample was educated at the primary school level, 31% completed high school and 22.4 % had higher education. The SLUMS internal consistency was 0.7031. The mean of total SLUMS score was 23.3 in no demented residents, 19.3 among those identified as having cognitive impairments and 13.1 residents with suspected dementia.

The SLUMS is not just another screening tool that can complement the range of existing cognitive tests in Polish clinical practice, but according to statistical analysis it demonstrates superior capabilities in the screening diagnosis compared to the most famous scale used in Poland - MMSE.","cited":31,"publisher":"WYDAWNICZY POLSKIEGO TOWARZYSTWA","year":2016,"volume":"50","issue":"2","pages":16},{"authors":"Suykens, Bert","title":"The Past, Present and Future of Slum Property Regimes in Chittagong, Bangladesh","source":"SOUTH ASIA-JOURNAL OF SOUTH ASIAN STUDIES","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"This article argues for the need to take time into account when understanding land ownership in slums.

Lessons from co-managed slum upgrading via participatory budget","source":"HABITAT INTERNATIONAL","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"What can the Participatory Budget (PB) teach us about slum upgrading in the cities of the Global South? This article describes the process of slum upgrading via PB in Porto Alegre, Brazil. Participatory budgeting_PB is a renowned mechanism of resource allocation that transfers decision-making power over the capital expenditure portion of the municipal budget from the City Council to public assemblies. However, the impact of PB on municipal service delivery in general and housing in particular is understudied. Ethnographic findings are based on slum upgrading process via PB in an informal settlement in the East District of Porto Alegre. Fieldwork included 16 interviews with residents who had been PB delegates, PB councilors, municipal architects, lawyers, and the social worker involved in the slum upgrading project of Vila Radiante, East District. Furthermore, analysis of district-level expenditures on public works required for slum upgrading as well as analysis of site plans informed the conclusions. The Porto Alegre PB demonstrates that slum dwellers' involvement in all stages of the slum upgrading process, from resource allocation to service delivery, contributed to the effective distribution of housing and basic infrastructure. Slum dwellers are a heterogeneous group with diverse housing needs. Housing via PB addresses this diversity and provides an alternative to the dichotomist debate in international planning between, on one hand, slum clearance followed by public housing projects and, on the other, the promotion of assisted self-help housing through programs of land tenure and basic infrastructure provision.

An essential feature of India?s urbanization has been the growth and persistence of slums in its fast-developing cities. Whether living conditions in Indian slums constitute a path to human development or a poverty trap to much of their population is therefore an issue of vital importance. Here, we analyse data from the Census of India using the framework of urban scaling to systematically characterize the relative properties of Indian urban slums, focusing on attributes of neighborhoods such as access to basic services like water, sanitation, and electricity. We find that slums in larger cities attract more migrants and offer, on average, higher levels of service access than those in smaller cities. We posit that these outcomes are a consequence of both agglomeration effects in larger cities and sub-linear scaling of infrastructure as predicted by urban scaling theory. We also find consistent under-performance in service access in slums, in comparison with non-slum neighborhoods in the same cities. However, urban slums, on average, offer greater access to services than rural areas. This situation, which we quantify systematically, may help explain why larger Indian cities have remained attractive to rural populations in terms of living standards, beyond the need for an economic income premium. Finally, based on the analysis of scaling residuals, we construct a nationwide urban geography of slums, essentially finding that public service delivery in the slums of northern, central, and eastern Indian cities is, on average, poorer than slums in cities of southern and western India. Overall, these findings suggest that urban policy needs to confront two distinct kinds of urban inequity ? across neighbourhoods within cities, and across city scales and levels of development. ? 2021 The Authors.

Slums denotes collection of people from various communities having a meagre income and living in unhygienic conditions thus making themselves most vulnerable for outbreaks of communicable diseases. India contributes substantially to the global disease burden and under-five mortality rates i.e. 20% attributable to vaccine preventable diseases. Immunization plays a crucial role in combating high childhood mortality rates attributable to vaccine preventable diseases across the globe. This systematic review, provides insights on immunization status in slums, identifies various factors influencing it thus, exploring opportunities that may be available to improve vaccination coverage under the National Immunization Program. Methods: Taking into account the above aspects, a review of literature was undertaken in various databases that included studies published between 2006 and 2017. Results: In India, similar to 33% of the urban population lives in slums with suboptimal vaccination coverage ranging from 14% to upto 90%. Few of the important causes for low coverage included socioeconomic factors such as poor community participation, lack of awareness, frequent migration, and loss of daily income. Hence, mere presence of vaccines in the National Immunization Program doesn't do the job, there is a definite unmet need to emphasize upon the importance of immunization among slums dwellers and take necessary steps. For instance, delivering immunization services at the doorstep (e.g. pulse polio program), community-based education, text messaging as reminders and incentivized immunization services are some of the opportunities that can be explored and implemented to improve immunization status in the slums. Conclusion: Thus, in addition to inclusion of more and more vaccines in the National Immunization Program, there is a definite need to focus on people living in high risk areas in order to improve coverage and healthcare indicators.","cited":50,"publisher":"ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE","year":2018,"volume":"112","pages":7},{"authors":"Tandel, Vaidehi; Gandhi, Sahil; Patranabis, Shaonlee; Bettencourt, Luis M.

Using geolocated containment zones and COVID-19 case data for Mumbai, India's most populous city, we find that cases and case fatality rates are higher in slums compared with formal residential buildings. Our results show that access to toilets for men is associated with lower COVID-19 prevalence. However, the effect is opposite in the case of toilets for women. This could be because limited hours for safely using toilets and higher waiting times increase the risk of exposure, and women and children sharing toilet facilities results in crowding. Proximity to water pipelines has no effect on prevalence, likely because slumdwellers are disconnected from formal water supply networks. Indoor crowding does not seem to have an effect on case prevalence. Finally, while police capacity-measured by number of police station outposts-is associated with lower prevalence in nonslum areas, indicating effective enforcement of containment, this relationship does not hold in slums.

Second, informality is a paradoxical condition that can be identified with the illegality, insecurity and inferiority of the slum, but also with the incremental self-organisation of urban commoning and the right to the city. Third, while the language of the 'slum' will inevitably persist, the UN-Habitat definition is both too broad and too narrow - conflating material conditions with overcrowding and tenure insecurity while excluding overdevelopment. Finally, if we want to understand `informal settlement' as a dominant mode of urban production then we need to stop using it interchangeably with the term 'slum' and engage with how it works as the design and planning of housing and urban infrastructure.","cited":31,"publisher":"LIVERPOOL UNIV PRESS","year":2021,"volume":"43","issue":"2","pages":12},{"authors":"Pandit, Kavita","title":"COMMENTS ON NIJMAN'S 'A STUDY OF SPACE IN MUMBAI'S SLUMS'","source":"TIJDSCHRIFT VOOR ECONOMISCHE EN SOCIALE GEOGRAFIE","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"This commentary on Nijman's presentation at the 100th anniversary celebration of TESG underlines how his study of the Mumbai slum reconciles the multiple dualisms that lie at the core of the study of economic and social geography.

Sample size was calculated as 1100 households and demographic parameters at the household level and parameters related to priority health conditions (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, anaemia and malnutrition) at the individual level were studied.Six zones within the slum were purposively selected and all the contiguous households were selected. The last of the six zones was partially surveyed as the desired sample size was achieved.ResultsA total of 1186 households were surveyed and 3693 people were screened. More than three fourth (70.4%) of the population were below poverty line. Only one third had a regular job and the average daily income was 5.3$ and 2.6$ in men and women respectively. The prevalence of hypertension (35.5%), diabetes (16.6%) and anaemia (70.9%) was high in the screened slum population. Most of the people (56.5% of hypertensives and 34.4% diabetics) were screened for the first time. Almost half of the children under the age of five years were stunted.ConclusionsPoor income security and huge burden of health issues were reported among adults and children in the household health screening in a large notified slum in South India. Most people were unaware of their disease condition prior to the screening. Relatively simple technological solutions enabled the local health team to screen the slum population despite many challenges.","funding":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) under the Global Challenges Research Fund (GCRF)UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC); CLAHRC Yorkshire and Humber","cited":38,"publisher":"BMC","year":2019,"volume":"19","pages":12},{"authors":"Das, Moumita; Angeli, Federica; van Schayck, Onno C.

The current study adds to the growing evidence that ordinary members of the urban slums can articulate critical linkages between their everyday sociocultural realities and health conditions, which can support the design and delivery of interventions to promote wellbeing. The concept of health is not confined to an abstract idea but manifested in slum-dwellers' sporadic practices of preventive and curative care as well as everyday living arrangements, where a complex arrangement of physical, psychological, financial, sociocultural and environmental dimensions condition their body and wellbeing.","cited":82,"publisher":"WILEY","year":2020,"volume":"42","issue":"5","pages":23},{"authors":"Nagpal, Anushree; Hassan, Mohammad; Siddiqui, Masood Ahsan; Tajdar, Atiqua; Hashim, Mohammad; Singh, Abhra; Gaur, Suman","title":"Missing basics: a study on sanitation and women's health in urban slums in Lucknow, India","source":"GEOJOURNAL","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"Sanitation is a multidimensional concept alluding primarily to provision of services for safe disposal of human excreta, provision of clean potable water as well as maintenance of hygiene through judicious means of wastewater and solid waste disposal.

An agent-based modelling study","source":"INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"The vulnerability of slum-dwellers to disasters requires particular attention due to the increasing frequency of disasters in slums combined with dilapidated housing conditions and lack of infrastructure. The absence of appropriate institutional and governmental aid has made slum-dwellers to rely upon their coping capacity. Having own financial capital can strengthen the coping capacity of an individual during disasters. Microfinance Institutes (MFIs) provide loans or microcredits to slum-dwellers to start a business individually or as a group, which eventually helps in increasing their financial capital. MFIs can also facilitate smooth repayment of loans by providing relief funds during disasters. However, frequent disasters might negatively influence the functioning of these mechanisms. Therefore, in this paper, we explore whether MFIs can increase the coping capacity of slum-dwellers by increasing their financial capital while facing disasters. Due to lack of empirical data on the impact of MFIs, we developed a stylised Agent-Based Model (ABM). The model includes interactions between slum-dwellers and an MFI as well as moneylenders. Slum-dwellers are facing disasters of varying frequency and intensity and can form ROtating Savings and Credit Associations (ROSCAs). Overall, the model results supported the claim that providing microcredits through MFIs has the potential to increase slum-dwellers' coping capacity while facing frequent disasters. However, the study also indicates that MFIs need to be carefully tailored to the local context in order to support slum-dwellers' coping capacity, for instance by adapting the repayment period.","funding":"ITC Excellence Scholarship","cited":74,"publisher":"ELSEVIER","year":2020,"volume":"49","pages":22},{"authors":"Ssensamba, Jude Thaddeus; Nakafeero, Mary; Ssemakula, Dennis Max; Ssenyonga, Ronald; Nnakate, Justine Bukenya","title":"The burden of HIV/AIDS among slum-dwelling school-age children in Kampala, Uganda","source":"HIV & AIDS REVIEW","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"Introduction: Adult and youthful slum dwellers have been documented to have a higher prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) compared to the general population. However, there is paucity of information on the extent of this infection among slum-dwelling school-age (5-14 years) children in Uganda. This study explored the burden of HIV among slum-dwelling school-age children (SDSAC) of Namuwongo, Kampala, Uganda. Material and methods: We analysed data derived from HIV counselling and testing records of school-age children that tested at Kisugu HCIII between 2011 and 2016. A total of 555 anonymised records were analysed for: residence, HIV, religious, and sex status. Using STATA version 13, bi-variate analysis was conducted to obtain joint distribution, and the two-sample test of proportions test was used to elicit associations and their significance. Results: The overall study population burden of HIV was 2%, with girls (2.6%) more affected than boys (0.9%). SDSAC had a higher HIV burden (3.3%) compared to non-slum dwellers (1.2%). HIV was more prevalent among slum-dwelling girls (5.2%) compared to their non-slum dwelling counterparts (0.9%).

The vast majority of slums are located in and around urban centres in the less economically developed countries, which are also experiencing greater rates of urbanization compared with more developed countries. This rapid rate of urbanization is cause for significant concern given that many of these countries often lack the ability to provide the infrastructure (e.g., roads and affordable housing) and basic services (e.g., water and sanitation) to provide adequately for the increasing influx of people into cities. While research on slums has been ongoing, such work has mainly focused on one of three constructs: exploring the socio-economic and policy issues; exploring the physical characteristics; and, lastly, those modelling slums. This paper reviews these lines of research and argues that while each is valuable, there is a need for a more holistic approach for studying slums to truly understand them. By synthesizing the social and physical constructs, this paper provides a more holistic synthesis of the problem, which can potentially lead to a deeper understanding and, consequently, better approaches for tackling the challenge of slums at the local, national and regional scales.","funding":"George Mason University Libraries Open Access Publishing Fund","cited":126,"publisher":"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","year":2016,"volume":"3","issue":"1","pages":21},{"authors":"Pitcairn, Charlie F.

Brazil's large slum-dwelling population is often considered part of a general urban-poor demographic. This study aims to identify the prevalence and distribution of depression in Brazil and compare mental health inequalities between slum and non-slum populations. Methods Data were obtained from Brazil's 2019 National Health Survey. Slum residence was defined based on the UN-Habitat definition for slums and estimated from survey responses. Doctor-diagnosed depression, Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9)-screened depression and presence of undiagnosed depression (PHQ-9-screened depression in the absence of a doctor's diagnosis) were analysed as primary outcomes, alongside depressive symptom severity as a secondary outcome. Prevalence estimates for all outcomes were calculated. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to investigate the association of socioeconomic characteristics, including slum residence, with primary outcomes. Depressive symptom severity was analysed using generalised ordinal logistic regression. Results Nationally, the prevalence of doctor diagnosed, PHQ-9 screened and undiagnosed depression were 9.9% (95% confidence interval (CI): 9.5-10.3), 10.8% (95% CI: 10.4-11.2) and 6.9% (95% CI: 6.6-7.2), respectively. Slum residents exhibited lower levels of doctor-diagnosed depression than non-slum urban residents (8.6%; 95% CI: 7.9-9.3 v. 10.7%; 95% CI: 10.2-11.2), while reporting similar levels of PHQ-9-screened depression (11.3%; 95% CI: 10.4-12.1 v. 11.3%; 95% CI: 10.8-11.8). In adjusted regression models, slum residence was associated with a lower likelihood of doctor diagnosed (adjusted odds ratio (adjusted OR): 0.87; 95% CI: 0.77-0.97) and PHQ-9-screened depression (adjusted OR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.78-0.97). Slum residents showed a greater likelihood of reporting less severe depressive symptoms. There were significant ethnic/racial disparities in the likelihood of reporting doctor-diagnosed depression. Black individuals were less likely to report doctor-diagnosed depression (adjusted OR: 0.66; 95% CI: 0.57-0.75) than white individuals. A similar pattern was observed in Mixed Black (adjusted OR: 0.72; 95% CI: 0.66-0.79) and other (adjusted OR: 0.63; 95% CI: 0.45-0.88) ethnic/racial groups. Slum residents self-reporting a diagnosis of one or more chronic non-communicable diseases had greater odds of exhibiting all three primary depression outcomes. Conclusions Substantial inequalities characterise the distribution of depression in Brazil including in slum settings. People living in slums may have lower diagnosed rates of depression than non-slum urban residents. Understanding the mechanisms behind the discrepancy in depression diagnosis between slum and non-slum populations is important to inform health policy in Brazil, including in addressing potential gaps in access to mental healthcare.","cited":76,"publisher":"CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS","year":2021,"volume":"30","pages":13},{"authors":"Arandel, Christian; Wetterberg, Anna","title":"Between Authoritarian and Empowered slum relocation: Social mediation in the case of Ennakhil, Morocco","source":"CITIES","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"Over the past four decades, as urbanization has increased in the Global South, pressures have mounted apace to convert slums to higher value use. In spite of policy shifts towards including residents' viewpoints, involuntary resettlement remains inherently conflictive on at least two levels: between residents and outside actors and among residents themselves. In this paper we present a social mediation approach that addresses these two levels of conflict, illustrating its application in a slum relocation program in Ennakhil, Morocco. Social mediation occupies a middle ground between an authoritarian, urban planning approach to relocation and resettlement programs that have community empowerment as an explicit objective. We argue that a clear emphasis on mediating conflict should be more widely incorporated in slum relocation and other development programs. While the social mediation approach has clear advantages over authoritarian approaches, it is also better suited than the empowerment approach for projects that, like involuntary resettlement, inherently generate conflict and limit the opportunities for disadvantaged groups to control decisions.

The objectives of this study are to examine the prevalence, potential predictors, and sequelae of MSK among older adults residing in two low resource informal urban settlements or slums in Nairobi Kenya. Methods: Data on older adults aged 60 years and over from two unrelated cross-sectional surveys on the older slum populations are used: a 2006/7 survey on the social, health, and overall wellbeing of older people (sample N = 831), and a 2016 survey on realities and impacts of long-term care and social protection for older adults (sample n = 1026). Uni and multivariate regressions on the 200617 data are employed to examine relationships of back pain and symptoms of arthritis with sex, age, wealth, unemployment, diagnoses of hypertension, and diabetes; and with indicators of subjective well-being and functional ability. Descriptive frequencies and chi-squared tests of association are used on 2016 data to identify the overall prevalence and locations of activity limiting MSK pain, and sex differences in these. Results: Prevalence of past month back pain and past 2 week symptoms of arthritis was 44% and 42.6%, respectively. Respective prevalence of past month activity limiting back pain and joint pain was 13.9% and 22.7%. A total of 42.6% of slum residents with a current health problem report MSK as the most severe problem. In multivariate regressions, female sex, unemployment, and diagnosis of hypertension are predictive of back pain and symptoms of arthritis. Both conditions are associated with raised odds of having lower quality of life, poorer life satisfaction, and depressive symptoms, and with mobility impairments and self care difficulties. Conclusions: MSK conditions are salient, and a likely key cause of impaired subjective well-being and functioning among older slum populations in SSA. Further research on determinants and consequences of such conditions in older slum populations is required to inform debate on responses to MSK as part of efforts to reorient SSA health systems to aging and to improve slum health.

The poorest and most disadvantaged populations, such as those living in slums, are considered to be extremely vulnerable to non-communicable diseases and their risk factors, especially tobacco use. The objective of this study was to assess the current status of tobacco consumption among slum dwellers and its association with socio-demographic factors. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in three slums of Dhaka city. Information about tobacco use as well as socio-demographic characteristics was collected from adult slum dwellers via face to face interviews using WHO STEPS questionnaire.

Moreover, written materials and political ephemera generated within slums are rarely preserved in accessible state archives, limiting the usefulness of conventional archival research. In such contexts, the discovery of informal archives-unmapped, non-systematized collections of materials kept by individuals and groups in the spaces under study-can contribute to the reconstruction of local histories. This article draws on 20 months of fieldwork in India's urban slums to offer insights on the collection and use of informal archival materials. These materials afford an intimate look at how the urban poor organize and make claims on the state. Their analysis, however, involves inferential challenges. Researchers must consider how processes of production, preservation, and provision shape the content of gathered historical materials and thus the inferences that can be drawn from them.

Its unprecedented growth has resulted in a large section of the population living in abject poverty in overcrowded slums. There have been limited efforts to capture the health of people in urban slums. In the present study, we have used data collected during the National Family Health Survey-3 to provide a national representation of women's reproductive health in the slum population in India. We examined a sample of 4,827 women in the age group of 15-49 years to assess the association of the variable slum with selected reproductive health services. We have also tried to identify the sociodemographic factors that influence the utilization of these services among women in the slum communities. All analyses were stratified by slum/non-slum residence, and multivariate logistic regression was used to analyze the strength of association between key reproductive health services and relevant sociodemographic factors. We found that less than half of the women from the slum areas were currently using any contraceptive methods, and discontinuation rate was higher among these women. Sterilization was the most common method of contraception (25%). Use of contraceptives depended on the age, level of education, parity, and the knowledge of contraceptive methods (p < 0.05). There were significant differences in the two populations based on the timing and frequency of antenatal visits. The probability of ANC visits depended significantly on the level of education and economic status (p < 0.05). We found that among slum women, the proportion of deliveries conducted by skilled attendants was low, and the percentage of home deliveries was high. The use of skilled delivery care was found to be significantly associated with age, level of education, economic status, parity, and prior antenatal visits (p < 0.05). We found that women from slum areas depended on the government facilities for reproductive health services. Our findings suggest that significant differences in reproductive health outcomes exist among women from slum and non-slum communities in India. Efforts to progress towards the health MDGs and other national or international health targets may not be achieved without a focus on the urban slum population.","cited":18,"publisher":"SPRINGER","year":2010,"volume":"87","issue":"2","pages":14},{"authors":"Borsuk, Imren","title":"Gendered dispossession and women's changing poverty by slum/squatter redevelopment projects: A case study from Turkey","source":"ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING A-ECONOMY AND SPACE","language":"English","doc":"Article; Early Access","abstract":"Informal settlements have been crucial sites of spatial dispossession and neoliberal urbanization with the displacement of the urban poor from profitable urban areas.

Undertaking comprehensive desk review of relevant literature and adapting Fraser's 'tripartite' approach to social justice, the paper analyses three slum upgrading interventions in Kenya, Brazil and Thailand. The paper revealed that interventions in Kenya and Brazil implicitly aimed at ensuring spatial order and hence, focused majorly on physical projects with minimal focus on identifying and incorporating the diverse needs of residents. This resulted in the non- or minimal use of delivered projects. Contrary to this, the diverse needs of residents were considered and adequately reflected in the case of Thailand. The consideration of diversity in the slum upgrading interventions was observed to fundamentally stem from project objectives set by the implementing institutions.

Previous research suggests the absence of lighting, inadequate provision of basic sanitation, poor design and siting of toilets, and lack of police presence in slums as facilitators for violence against women. However, the evidence is often anecdotal and usually unsystematic. The exact extent of crimes against women in these circumstances is unknown because unsurprisingly women in slums rarely report crimes to the police, either due to fear or lack of access. The research reported in this paper gauges women's perception and experience of crime and violence around different types of public toilets in two slums areas in Mumbai, India. A survey of 142 households indicated that although women's fear of crime was higher than their actual experience, the perception of insecurity was not uniform for all toilet types and locations. Findings also indicated that there was at least minimal provision of toilet facilities, basic security features, water, and electric supply in the research sites. Furthermore, greater police presence and previous contact with the police in one slum area led for greater confidence in reporting offences to the police as compared to the other. Overall, better provision of lighting and regular police patrols were considered by a majority of those surveyed to reduce fear of crime around toilets.","funding":"UCL [1413/003]","cited":43,"publisher":"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","year":2017,"volume":"41","issue":"1-2","pages":16},{"authors":"Prabhu, R.; Raja, R.

The study adopted field survey, oral interview and laboratory tests of water and soil samples for concentration levels of poisonous metals using the Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy. Principal component analysis of Factor Analysis was used to select significant causes, environmental health challenges, government responses, and ways-out and ways-forward from those suggested by respondents. Findings showed that there were thirty (30) slums in Abuja. The actual causes of slum development were poverty, inequality, inadequate and non-affordable housing for all classes of the citizenry, rural-urban migration, urbanization, poor house planning, poor infrastructure, social exclusion, economic stagnation, informal economy, and labour and work. Waste generation and management situation was unhealthy with poor sanitation practices. Correlation matrix showed significance level above 99% for all indicators. Factor scores showed a perfect correlation above confidence level of 0.05 and very high significance level above 99% in all matrix variables. Open drains and waste dumps characterized Abuja ghettoes and were significant precursors of the outbreak of health devastating diseases in Abuja slums through pollution of air, domestic water sources and soil. Correlation matrix for environmental health challenges showed significance scores above 99% and correlation matrix scores were above 0.5 for all indicators. Water and soil in the slums were highly polluted by toxic metals. Against the World Health Organization (WHO) standard of 0.05 mg/litre for Cd, 0.03 mg/litre for Cr and 0.4 mg/litre for Pb, heavy metal concentration in water sources was too high at 1.1-1.9 mg/litre for Cd, 1.4-1.6.4 mg/litre for Cr and 1.5-1.6 mg/litre for Pb.

Six key areas emerged from the analysis of the case studies that link slum upgrading to climate change adaptation and mitigation through infrastructure and policies: (1) security of tenure, (2) relocation and barriers, (3) public space, (4) energy-efficient and improved architecture, (5) connectivity, and (6) land management.

Most deaths (98%) occur in the developing world. Although India has made substantial progress in maternal health, it still accounts for 25% of global maternal deaths and the maternal death rate is even worse in the exploding slums of India. The study aimed to assess the preference and practices regarding the place of childbirth and to identify the factors affecting the choice among married women in the slums of Aligarh. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted from July 2012 to June 2013 in two urban slums of Aligarh with sample of 405 women's selected using systematic random sampling. Information about the childbirth practices such as place of childbirth and reason for choosing a particular facility for childbirth was recorded along with the socio-demographic data; women's age, education, occupation, religion, type of family, socioeconomic status and birth order. Chi square test was used to examine the differences between the groups. RESULTS: Of 405 childbirths, 58.3% were born in a hospital. Most common reason for in-hospital or at-home childbirths were safety (47.5%) and tradition (37.3%) respectively. Among 405 women, 301 women (74.4%) received antenatal care (ANC) services while 208 women (51.4%) received adequate ANC visits (>= 3 ANC visits). Better antenatal care utilization, higher levels of education of women and standard of living, lower birth order of the child led to increased utilization of hospitals for childbirth in a significant manner. CONCLUSION: Home based child birth was observed to be a common practice in slum areas.

India's urbanisation is best described as pseudo-urbanisation, a condition in which a large city is formed without a functional infrastructure to support it. Migration and pseudo-urbanisation lead to demographic explosion and a progressive concentration of poor migrants in the cities, followed by misery, poverty, unemployment, exploitation, rapid growth of slums and degradation in the quality of urban life. Slums are usually characterised by poor housing conditions, inadequate physical infrastructure, deprivations in socio-economic conditions, health, hygiene and lack of safety and security.

Former urban development policies favoured capital-intensive industries and the rapid growth of a low-wage informal sector. Subsidised transport systems allowed poor people to live and work in the city. Mumbai's poor housing is also a reflection of a poor and inappropriate urban planning system, a lack of public investment and restrictions in the land and rental housing market. The failure of the city authorities to cope with the urban poor is highlighted by a review of the main housing policies implemented in the city. These range from slum clearance and the construction of high-rise apartment blocks to a range of self-help strategies and current privatised market-led schemes.

In Nepal, as in most low-income countries, infants are immunized with standard WHO recommended vaccines. However, 16.4 % of children did not receive complete immunization by 12 months of age in Nepal in 2011. Studies from different parts of the world showed that incomplete immunization is even higher in slums. The objective of this study was to identify the predictors of incompletion of immunization among children aged 12-23 months living in the slums of Kathmandu Valley, Nepal. Methods: The unmatched case-control study was conducted in 22 randomly selected slums of Kathmandu Valley. The sampling frame was first identified by complete enumeration of entire households of the study area from which 59 incompletely immunized children as cases and 177 completely immunized children as controls were chosen randomly in 1: 3 ratio. Data were collected from the primary caretakers of the children. Backward logistic regression with 95 % confidence interval and adjusted odds ratio (AOR) were applied to assess the factors independently associated with incomplete immunization. Result: Twenty-six percent of the children were incompletely vaccinated. The coverage of BCG vaccine was 95.0 % while it was 80.5 % for measles vaccine. The significant predictors of incomplete immunization were the home delivery of a child, the family residing on rent, a primary caretaker with poor knowledge about the schedule of vaccination and negative perception towards vaccinating a sick child, conflicting priorities, and development of abscess following immunization. Conclusion: Reduction of abscess formation rate can be a potential way to improve immunization rates. Community health volunteers should increase their follow-up on children born at home and those living in rent. Health institutions and volunteers should be influential in creating awareness about immunization, its schedule, and post-vaccination side effects.","cited":37,"publisher":"BMC","year":2016,"volume":"16","pages":9},{"authors":"Choudhury, Nuzhat; Moran, Allisyn C.; Alam, M.

Bangladesh, one of the poorest and most densely-populated countries in the world, has been facing rapid urbanization. In urban areas, maternal indicators are generally worse in the slums than in the urban non-slum areas. The Manoshi program at BRAC, a non governmental organization, works to improve maternal, newborn, and child health in the urban slums of Bangladesh. This paper describes maternal related beliefs and practices in the urban slums of Dhaka and provides baseline information for the Manoshi program. Methods: This is a descriptive study where data were collected using both quantitative and qualitative methods. The respondents for the quantitative methods, through a baseline survey using a probability sample, were mothers with infants (n = 672) living in the Manoshi program areas. Apart from this, as part of a formative research, thirty six in-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted during the same period from two of the above Manoshi program areas among currently pregnant women who had also previously given births (n = 18); and recently delivered women (n = 18). Results: The baseline survey revealed that one quarter of the recently delivered women received at least four antenatal care visits and 24 percent women received at least one postnatal care visit. Eighty-five percent of deliveries took place at home and 58 percent of the deliveries were assisted by untrained traditional birth attendants. The women mostly relied on their landladies for information and support. Members of the slum community mainly used cheap, easily accessible and available informal sectors for seeking care. Cultural beliefs and practices also reinforced this behavior, including home delivery without skilled assistance. Conclusions: Behavioral change messages are needed to increase the numbers of antenatal and postnatal care visits, improve birth preparedness, and encourage skilled attendance at delivery.

As the urban population grows, so does the proportion of these persons living in slums where conditions are deplorable. These conditions concentrate health hazards leading to higher rates of morbidity and mortality. This growing problem creates a unique challenge for policymakers and public health practitioners. While the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) aim to address these conditions and standards for water and sanitation as well as pertinent health outcomes, little evidence on interventions exists to guide policymakers. Upgrades in slum household water and sanitation systems have not yet been rigorously evaluated to demonstrate whether there is a direct link to improved health outcomes. This study aims to show that slum upgrading as carried out in Ahmedabad, India, led to a significant decline in waterborne illness incidence. We employ a quasi-experimental regression model using health insurance claims (for 2001-2008) as a proxy for passive surveillance of disease incidence. We found that slum upgrading reduced a claimant's likelihood of claiming for waterborne illness from 32% to 14% and from 25% to 10% excluding mosquito-related illnesses. This study shows that upgrades in slum household infrastructure can lead to improved health outcomes and help achieve the MDGs.

Objective To detect growth and developmental delays and related risk factors among under-five children living in an inner-city slum area of the Indonesian capital. Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted from October to November 2018 in Tanah Tinggi, Johar Baru District, an inner-city slum area in Central Jakarta. Subjects were healthy children aged 3-60 months. Socioeconomic profile was obtained through questionnaires, anthropometric data through measurements, and developmental status through the Kuesioner Pra Skrining Perkembangan (KPSP) instrument. Development was considered to be delayed for KPSP scores <9. Data were analyzed using Chi-square test. Results Of 211 subjects, prevalence of underweight, stunting, and wasting were 35.1%, 28.0%, and 20.9%, respectively, meanwhile low maternal education, and low family income were 57.9% and 75%. The prevalence of developmental delay was 10%, while suspected developmental delay was 26.1%. The prevalence increased from age 21 months and peaked at 36 months. Associated risk factors were low maternal education, low family income, underweight weight-for-age, stunted height-for-age, and microcephalic head circumference-for-age. Conclusion Low education and low income were significant risk factors for growth and developmental delay.","funding":"Department of Child Health Universitas Indonesia Medical School, Pediatric Specialist Residents' Community Development Fund [383/L/PPDS IKA/VIII/2018]","cited":30,"publisher":"INDONESIAN PEDIATRIC SOC PUBLISHING HOUSE","year":2019,"volume":"59","issue":"5","pages":8},{"authors":"Minnery, John; Argo, Teti; Winarso, Haryo; Do Hau; Veneracion, Cynthia C.; Forbes, Dean; Childs, Iraphne","title":"Slum upgrading and urban governance: Case studies in three South East Asian cities","source":"HABITAT INTERNATIONAL","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"Whilst slum upgrading is often seen as one of the more effective ways of tackling urban poverty, the approaches taken by slum upgrading policies vary considerably, as do their degrees of success.

Studies have shown lower intake of many nutrients in such people, but no study yet has checked the quality of diet using Healthy Eating Index (HEI) in them. This study aims to assess the quality of diet among slum dwellers of Tehran using the HEI-2015. Design/methodology/approach This cross-sectional study was conducted among 300 slum dwellers from two slums located on the border of Tehran city which is the capital of Iran. Stratified random sampling technique was used to select subjects for this study. Data on socioeconomic characteristics and 24-hours dietary recalls were obtained through face-to-face interviews with the respondents by trained personnel. Findings The overall diet quality of the respondents was poor, with a mean HEI score of 40.9 +/- 23.7. About 84% of the participants had low overall HEI scores. A significant relation was seen in the following: the HEI and educational level (p = 0.044); the HEI and employment status (p = 0.001); and the HEI and chronic diseases (p = 0.049). There was no significant difference between the mean HEI score and marital status, welfare status and addiction status. From the findings, the diet of most of these slum dwellers needs modification.

Hence, we conducted a hydro-geochemical study in a shallow sandy aquifer in Bwaise III parish, an urban slum area in Kampala, Uganda, to assess the geochemical processes controlling the transport and fate of dissolved nutrients (NO3, NH4 and PO4) released from on-site sanitation systems to groundwater. Groundwater was collected from 26 observation wells. The samples were analyzed for major ions (Ca, Mg, Na, Mg, Fe, Mn, Cl and SO4) and nutrients (o-PO4, NO3 and NH4). Data was also collected on soil characteristics, aquifer conductivity and hydraulic heads. Geochemical modeling using PHREEQC was used to determine the level of o-PO4 control by mineral solubility and sorption. Groundwater below the slum area was anoxic and had near neutral pH values, high values of EC (average of 1619 mu S/cm) and high concentrations of Cl (3.2 mmol/L), HCO3 (11 mmol/L) and nutrients indicating the influence from wastewater leachates especially from pit latrines. Nutrients were predominantly present as NH4 (1-3 mmol/L; average of 2.23 mmol/L). The concentrations of NO3 and o-PO4 were, however, low: average of 0.2 mmol/L and 6 mu mol/L respectively. We observed a contaminant plume along the direction of groundwater flow (NE-SW) characterized by decreasing values of EC and Cl, and distinct redox zones. The redox zones transited from NO3-reducing in upper flow areas to Fe-reducing in the lower flow areas. Consequently, the concentrations of NO3 decreased downgradient of the flow path due to denitrification. Ammonium leached directly into the alluvial aquifer was also partially removed because the measured concentrations were less than the potential input from pit latrines (3.2 mmol/L). We attributed this removal (about 30%) to anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) given that the cation exchange capacity of the aquifer was low (<6 meq/100 g) to effectively adsorb NH4. Phosphate transport was, on the other hand, greatly retarded and our results showed that this was due to the adsorption of P to calcite and the co-precipitation of P with calcite and rhodochrosite. Our findings suggest that shallow alluvial sandy aquifers underlying urban slum areas are an important sink of excessive nutrients leaching from on-site sanitation systems. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

With an estimated 1 billion slum dwellers globally, the United Nations have made the fight against poverty the number one sustainable development goal. To provide better infrastructure and thus a better life to slum dwellers, detailed information on the spatial location and size of slums is of crucial importance. In the past, remote sensing has proven to be an extremely valuable and effective tool for mapping slums. The nature of used mapping approaches by machine learning, however, made it necessary to invest a lot of effort in training the models. Recent advances in deep learning allow for transferring trained fully convolutional networks (FCN) from one data set to another. Thus, in our study we aim at analyzing transfer learning capabilities of FCNs to slum mapping in various satellite images. A model trained on very high resolution optical satellite imagery from QuickBird is transferred to Sentinel-2 and TerraSAR-X data. While free-of-charge Sentinel 2 data is widely available, its comparably lower resolution makes slum mapping a challenging task. TerraSAR-X data on the other hand, has a higher resolution and is considered a powerful data source for infra-urban structure analysis. Due to the different image characteristics of SAR compared to optical data, however, transferring the model could not improve the performance of semantic segmentation but we observe very high accuracies for mapped slums in the optical data: QuickBird image obtains 86-88% (positive prediction value and sensitivity) and a significant increase for Sentinel-2 applying transfer learning can be observed (from 38 to 55% and from 79 to 85% for PPV and sensitivity, respectively). Using transfer learning proofs extremely valuable in retrieving information on small-scaled urban structures such as slum patches even in satellite images of decametric resolution.","funding":"European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programmeEuropean Research Council (ERC) [ERC-2016-StG-714087]","cited":59,"publisher":"ELSEVIER","year":2019,"volume":"150","pages":11},{"authors":"Meredith, Thomas; MacDonald, Melanie","title":"Community-supported slum-upgrading: Innovations from Kibera, Nairobi, Kenya","source":"HABITAT INTERNATIONAL","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"Slum upgrading is accepted as a priority for sustainable development. While there are clear challenges to upgrading, local support and community engagement are seen as essential to success. Typical top down approaches led by institutions with power and resources may fail to generate local engagement. Conversely, initiatives led by non-governmental organizations (NGOs), community-based organizations (CBOs) or other self-help groups may garner good community support but may lack institutional and material resources to meet objectives. A hybrid approach that engages the community while mobilizing the resources of governments and large agencies can overcome some of these limitations, but it is not without complications. We examine the process and impact of a slum upgrading pilot project in Kibera, Nairobi, Kenya, that operationalized this hybrid approach by adopting an adaptive management model to promote community engagement. The project was part of the Government of Kenya's Kenya Slum Upgrading Program and involved the Kibera Water and Sanitation Project led by UN-Habitat's Urban Basic Services Branch. The project showed significant early success in building community engagement, but it also encountered significant challenges. We assess the project's success in building community engagement by (a) analyzing documents that reflected the institutional discourse related to the project, (b) examining the record of the implementation of the project, and (c) conducting field surveys and interviews to assess community perception of the project. Survey results show that critical infrastructure in the community has improved over the course of the project and expectations for continued improvement in the future have developed. The study concludes that using an adaptive management approach and strongly promoting community involvement should be the aim of institutions delivering slum-upgrading projects and that this can result in effective, successful development outcomes. While the approach does present significant risks of creating unrealistic expectations, the benefits to project management are clear. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This study aimed to examine the prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding, its promoters and barriers in urban slums of Bihar, India. Methods: We conducted a community based cross-sectional survey involving 297 mothers living in slum settlements in Bihar. Data were collected using structured questionnaire on exclusive breastfeeding practices, and the factors that could influence this. Descriptive analysis was done to estimate the prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding and regression model was performed to identify the predictors of exclusive breastfeeding. Results: Only 23% of mothers initiate breastfeeding within 1 hour of delivery and 27.6% mothers practise exclusive breastfeeding up to six months. Mother's education was found to be associated with duration of exclusive breastfeeding (OR 11, 95% CI 2-59). Term babies were more likely to be breastfed exclusively for six months than pre-term babies (OR 8.6, 95% CI 1.6-47.6). Antenatal care visits and completing immunization were significantly associated with duration of exclusive breastfeeding (P < 0.001). The majority of mothers acquire exclusive breastfeeding knowledge through television/radio (OR 68, 95% CI 5.5-832.5) and newspaper advertisements (OR 14, 95% CI 2.6-76). Conclusion: Prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding up to six months of age and early initiation of breastfeeding remains low in slums of Bihar.

The work is based on the analysis of archival documents from the two main archives of the West Siberian oil and gas complex - the State archives of the Tyumen region and the State archives of socio-political history of the Tyumen region. The author conducted field research in the slums of cities in oil-producing regions of Siberia and interviewed experts on urban planning in the region. The novelty of the work lies in the fact that in Russian and foreign historiography there was virtually no research devoted to the formation of slums in the process of urbanization of the Soviet Union. In this article the author tries to show the mechanisms of creation of slums in the USSR cities through the example of oil and gas development in Siberia from the 1960s to the 1980s. The study shows that the emergence of slums resulted from the policy of the Soviet government, ministries, and departments (geologists, oilmen, and builders) that operated the oil region of Siberia. The urbanization developed uncontrollably here due to spontaneous and chaotic migration of huge numbers of workers whom the departments prompted to come and build the oil production complex in Siberia, whereas there was not enough decent housing available for everyone. Slums constituted a social mechanism of dealing with the housing problem. The departments themselves often built slums for their workers, and the slums would ultimately become the most important source of citywide and departmental identification for many city residents in the oil-producing areas of Siberia. Slums as a basis for self-identification acted as a social filter which ensured that only those who were best prepared, both psychologically and physically, and who linked their future with Siberia, would stay in the oil region.","funding":"Russian Foundation for the Humanities [16-31-01014]","cited":26,"publisher":"TOMSK STATE UNIV","year":2017,"issue":"2","pages":20},{"authors":"Singh, Sanjeev; Sahu, Damodar; Agrawal, Ashish; Vashi, Meeta Dhaval","title":"Barriers and opportunities for improving childhood immunization coverage in slums: A qualitative study","source":"PREVENTIVE MEDICINE REPORTS","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"There is substantial variability in immunization coverage trends across the globe which can be attributed to a number of factors such as demographic profile, socioeconomic characteristics and political environment.

This was a community based cross-sectional study conducted in the slum areas of Mumbai, India. Data from the observations of immunization sessions and interviews of end users, healthcare service providers, and influencers were collected and analyzed. Lack of time, poor awareness, fear of adverse event, loss of daily income, and migrant population were some of the major reasons to not get immunized. Also, lack of good behavior of staff was another crucial factor perceived by caretakers as barrier in the immunization. Stakeholders agreed that immunization is a shared responsibility involving community, service providers, and policy makers. There was general consensus that immunization practices have improved over the last few years. However, its positive impact is yet to be fully seen in populations that belong to lower socioeconomic strata, thus warranting additional efforts to improve the immunization coverage in slums. Effective communication, process improvement at various levels, active involvement of communities in the immunization activities, building trust and accountability, and constructive feedback are some of the essential elements to strengthen the immunization program. Strategies to improve immunization services in such settings should be based on interactions with stakeholders and understanding their perspectives.","cited":28,"publisher":"ELSEVIER","year":2019,"volume":"14","pages":6},{"authors":"Yorgri, Eunice; Leng, Hong","title":"Affordable Housing and Slum Emergence in Accra, Ghana","source":"2017 6TH EEM INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON EDUCATION SCIENCE AND SOCIAL SCIENCE (EEM-ESSS 2017)","language":"English","doc":"Proceedings Paper","abstract":"Housing is classified as one of the vital fundamental needs in every country and the growing debate on affordable housing in Ghana as in elsewhere in the world has been necessitated by the escalating demand for housing amidst limited supply from government, private sector and self-help.

Although several studies have focused on detecting slums from satellite images, only a few captured their variations. This study addresses this gap using an integrated approach that can identify a slums' degree of deprivation in terms of socio-economic variability in Bangalore, India using image features derived from very high resolution (VHR) satellite images. To characterize deprivation, we use multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) and quantify deprivation with a data-driven index of multiple deprivation (DIMD). We take advantage of spatial features learned by a convolutional neural network (CNN) from VHR satellite images to predict the DIMD. To deal with a small training dataset of only 121 samples with known DIMD values, insufficient to train a deep CNN, we conduct a two-step transfer learning approach using 1461 delineated slum boundaries as follows. First, a CNN is trained using these samples to classify slums and formal areas. The trained network is then fine-tuned using the 121 samples to directly predict the DIMD. The best prediction is obtained by using an ensemble non-linear regression model, combining the results of the CNN and models based on hand-crafted and geographic information system (GIS) features, with R-2 of 0.75. Our findings show that using the proposed two-step transfer learning approach, a deep CNN can be trained with a limited number of samples to predict the slums' degree of deprivation. This demonstrates that the CNN-based approach can capture variations of deprivation in VHR images, providing a comprehensive understanding of the socio-economic situation of slums in Bangalore.","funding":"SimCity project [C.2324.0293]; NWO/Netherlands eScience Center [27015G05]","cited":61,"publisher":"MDPI","year":2019,"volume":"11","issue":"11","pages":24},{"authors":"Wright, Susannah","title":"The work of teachers and others in and around a Birmingham slum school 1891-1920","source":"HISTORY OF EDUCATION","language":"English","doc":"Article; Proceedings Paper","abstract":"The 'Floodgate Street area' was a notorious slum district in the city of Birmingham in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.

This argument is presented through two sections of analysis and debate, using Vilakazi precinct in Soweto as a case study. Firstly, the paper analyses the emergence of township tourism as an academic focus in the literature and how it came to be classified as slum tourism, considering definitional conundrums. Various South African authors emphasise the struggle heritage character of township tourism. Secondly, the historical development of townships and tourism in these areas are interrogated. The empirical data offer the perspectives on tourism in their area from: (a) residents living in and around Vilakazi Street; and (b) tourists visiting the Vilakazi precinct. The analysis reveals that neither residents nor visitors consider the Vilakazi precinct or the larger area of Orlando West as a slum; rather they perceive tourism is the area to be connected to its struggle heritage. We accordingly stress that the term 'slum tourism' to describe township tourism in Soweto is inaccurate and is inconsistent with the views not only of residents and visitors, but also South African authors.","cited":79,"publisher":"SPRINGER","year":2020,"volume":"85","issue":"4","pages":17},{"authors":"Davalagi, Shubha B.; Revanna, Rashmi; Agadi, Nagarajachari","title":"Determinants of Post - partum contraception practices in urban slums of central Karnataka, India","source":"INDIAN JOURNAL OF COMMUNITY HEALTH","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"Background: The largest proportion of women with an unmet need for contraception is found among those in their first year after childbirth; concentrating efforts to reduce unmet need among these women could have additionally bigger impact on increasing contraceptive use than concentrating on any other group.

Unreserved category(UR) was found to be at lesser risk as compared to SC/ST (OR: 0.238;CI : 0.133-0.423).Nuclear families had more risk for undernutrition as compared to Joint families (OR:1.947;CI: 1.352-2.803),Illiterate mothers showed more risk (OR:5.696,CI:2.791-11.625) Similar results were obtained for illiterate fathers (OR: 3.950; CI:1.868-8.353) as compared to fathers having qualification of at least graduation. Females with one parity were protective for undernutrition (OR: 0.411; CI: 0.182-0.928).Low birth weight (OR: 1.996; CI: 1.332-2.991) and total member in family also played a significant role. Conclusion: Poverty and education predispose undernutrition in slum children. There is a need to undertake intervention through community education regarding breastfeeding, ANC, birth spacing and to adopt practices that favour good nutrition of child.","cited":23,"publisher":"INDIAN ASSOC PREVENTIVE & SOCIAL MEDICINE","year":2020,"volume":"32","issue":"3","pages":8},{"authors":"Izugbara, Chimaraoke; Ochako, Rhoune; Egesa, Carolyne; Tikkanen, Ronny","title":"Ethnicity, livelihoods, masculinity, and health among Luo men in the slums of Nairobi, Kenya","source":"ETHNICITY & HEALTH","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"Background Previous research suggests that ethnic self-identity has little consequence for objective health outcomes compared to the structural dimensions of ethnicity. Methods Using qualitative data, we investigated perceptions of ethnicity in relation to health among Luo men in the slums of Nairobi, Kenya. Results While recognizing the complicated cultural origin of poor health, responding Luo men stressed on gender and everyday livelihood situations as being more critical for their health than Luo customs. Recognition of the structural causes of ill-health among the men overlapped with lay notions derived from particular expressions of Luo culture in urban slum contexts. To some extent, respondents regarded the performance of their sense of ethnic identity as protective, though they also admitted to the health-damaging repercussions of some of the ways they enacted aspects of Luo culture. Conclusion Ethnic beliefs that link particular enactments of local customs with health outcomes may motivate the performance of cultural identity in ways that can produce critical health outcomes.","funding":"Ford Foundation [1105-0320]; William and Flora Hewlett Foundation [2006-8376]; Rockefeller Foundation [2008 AR 001]","cited":43,"publisher":"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","year":2013,"volume":"18","issue":"5","pages":16},{"authors":"Mehnaz, Saira; Abedi, Ali Jafar; Fazli, Shazia F.; Mushfiq, Sakeena; Khan, Zulfia; Ansari, M.

While remote sensing imagery is increasingly used for producing slum maps, only a few studies have analyzed their temporal dynamics. This study explores the potential of fully convolutional networks (FCNs) to analyze the temporal dynamics of small clusters of temporary slums using very high resolution (VHR) imagery in Bangalore, India. The study develops two approaches based on FCNs. The first approach uses a post-classification change detection, and the second trains FCNs to directly classify the dynamics of slums. For both approaches, the performances of 3 x 3 kernels and 5 x 5 kernels of the networks were compared. While classification results of individual years exhibit a relatively high F1-score (3 x 3 kernel) of 88.4% on average, the change accuracies are lower. The post-classification results obtained an F1-score of 53.8% and the change-detection networks obtained an F1-score of 53.7%. According to the trajectory error matrix (TEM), the post-classification results scored higher for the overall accuracy but lower for the accuracy difference of change trajectories than the change-detection networks. Although the two methods did not have significant differences in terms of accuracy, the change-detection network was less noisy. Within our study area, the areas of slums show a small overall decrease; the annual growth of slums (between 2012 and 2016) was 7173 m(2), in contrast to an annual decline of 8390 m(2). However, these numbers hid the spatial dynamics, which were much larger. Interestingly, areas where slums disappeared commonly changed into green areas, not into built-up areas. The proposed change-detection network provides a robust map of the locations of changes with lower confidence about the exact boundaries. This shows the potential of FCNs for detecting the dynamics of slums in VHR imagery.","funding":"[:27015G05]","cited":43,"publisher":"MDPI","year":2019,"volume":"11","issue":"23","pages":21},{"authors":"Madan, Neha Verma","title":"Ethnographic Perspectives on Slum-dwelling Women's Access to Primary Care: The Case of Pune, India","source":"URBANITIES-JOURNAL OF URBAN ETHNOGRAPHY","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"This article describes the methodology and results of a two-month empirical study based on a focused ethnography (FE) approach and aimed at exploring the Primary Health Care (PHC) experiences of women who live in slums in Pune, India.

The identification and prioritization of the key health issues occurring in these settings is essential for the development of programmes that aim to enhance the health of local slum communities effectively. As such, the present study sought to identify and prioritise the key health issues occurring in urban slums, with a focus on the perceptions of health professionals and community workers, in the rapidly growing city of Bangalore, India. Methods: The study followed a two-phased mixed methods design. During Phase I of the study, a total of 60 health conditions belonging to four major categories: -1) non-communicable diseases; 2) infectious diseases; 3) maternal and women's reproductive health; and 4) child health - were identified through a systematic literature review and semistructured interviews conducted with health professionals and other relevant stakeholders with experience working with urban slum communities in Bangalore. In Phase II, the health issues were prioritised based on four criteria through a consensus workshop conducted in Bangalore. Results: The top health issues prioritized during the workshop were: diabetes and hypertension (non-communicable diseases category), dengue fever (infectious diseases category), malnutrition and anaemia (child health, and maternal and women's reproductive health categories). Diarrhoea was also selected as a top priority in children. These health issues were in line with national and international reports that listed them as top causes of mortality and major contributors to the burden of diseases in India. Conclusions: The results of this study will be used to inform the development of technologies and the design of interventions to improve the health outcomes of local communities. Identification of priority health issues in the slums of other regions of India, and in other low and lower middle-income countries, is recommended.","funding":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) under the Global Challenges Research Fund (GCRF)","cited":71,"publisher":"BMC","year":2018,"volume":"18","pages":11},{"authors":"Raksanagara, Ardini S.; Santanu, Ayu Mutiara; Sari, Sri Yusnita Irda; Sunjaya, Deni K.; Arya, Insi Farisya Deasy; Agustian, Dwi","title":"Integrated Behavior Model: Factors Influencing Clean Water Use among Urban Slum Dwellers","source":"MAJALAH KEDOKTERAN BANDUNG-MKB-BANDUNG MEDICAL JOURNAL","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"The increasing need for clean water, especially in urban area, is becoming more prominent.

Among unprotected well users, attitude, environmental barriers, and habit influenced the behavior of using clean water. Factors influencing behaviors, especially in urban slum areas, are different based on the source of clean water used; hence, the implementation health promotion through behavioural change should be adapted to the type of water source used.","cited":18,"publisher":"UNIV PADJADJARAN, FAKULTAS KEDOKTERAN, GEDUNG RUMAH SAKIT PENDIDIKAN","year":2017,"volume":"49","issue":"2","pages":10},{"authors":"Lumagbas, Lily Beth C.","title":"Exploring the Ethics of Space in Slum Research during COVID-19 through the Lens of Merleau-Ponty","source":"ASIAN BIOETHICS REVIEW","language":"English","doc":"Article; Early Access","abstract":"COVID-19 modifies a number of social behaviors and standards that we have been following.

This study aims to contribute by applying object-based image analysis and intensity analysis to map and link patterns and processes of slum growth in Lagos. RapidEye imagery from 2009 and 2015 were used to create maps for each time point for six land use categories (water, vegetated area, open space, road, slum, and other urban). Intensity analysis was applied to quantify the annual intensity of changes at the category and transition level. An overall accuracy (and kappa coefficient) of 94% (0.9) and 89% (0.86) were achieved for the 2009 and 2015 land use and land cover maps, respectively. This study showed that slums in Lagos have increased spatially during the time interval studied, with a total net gain of 9.18 square kilometers, influenced by the increase in population, mainly due to in-migration to Lagos. However, this study also revealed that slums were actively losing and gaining land area between 2009 and 2015, with an annual gain and loss intensity of 10.08 and 6.41, respectively, compared to the uniform intensity of 3.15. The gain was due to poor maintenance of buildings and encroachment onto available spaces (water and open space), while the loss was attributed to gentrification and demolition processes. A systematic process of transition was observed between slums and other urban (and open space) areas in the interval studied, and this process was mainly influenced by the Lagos state government.

Thailand's Baan Mankong slum upgrading program adopts a people-driven approach to resolving problems of insecure housing and poor living conditions, putting slum residents at the core of the process. This paper explores, through interviews, how residents in four Bangkok communities perceive the outcomes of upgrading, particularly their new homes and tenure situation. Participant satisfaction is key to ensuring successful scaling up of Baan Mankong, as this is done through community-driven exchange and learning-by-doing. The results show that while the respondents appreciate their new houses and improved living environment, they are wary of the resulting debt burden. While tenure is regarded as secure in the short term, the long-term situation is not so clear.

Methodology: A cross-sectional study was carried out among 165 elderly (60 years of age and above), residing in urban slums of Kochi corporation. The hemoglobin level was measured using Heamocue and the dietary pattern was assessed by a structured pretested questionnaire eliciting a 7-day dietary recall. Results: The prevalence of anemia among the elderly was observed to be 60.6%, out of which 66% were females and 49% were males. The elderly females were found to be more vulnerable to anemia. Conclusion: Anemia was found to be significantly high among the elderly population in urban slums of Kochi. Regular screening and management of anemia along with dietary awareness have become the need of the hour.","cited":18,"publisher":"WOLTERS KLUWER MEDKNOW PUBLICATIONS","year":2020,"volume":"9","issue":"3","pages":5},{"authors":"De, Indranil; Nag, Tirthankar","title":"Local self-governance, ethnic division in slums and preference for water supply institutions in Kolkata, India","source":"WATER POLICY","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"This paper investigates the preferences for institutional mechanisms for improved water supply services across different ethnic communities in slums of Kolkata.

By focusing on writings from the period 1849-1865, this article pays attention to earlier conceptions and projections of slum interiors which were conceived as not altogether abject or other', but as ambivalent spaces that both defied, and invoked, Victorian forms of domesticity. Through close readings of their textual and visual form, I show how the paradoxical and ambivalent spaces of the slum interior reconfigure in meaningful ways the conventional relations of domestic architecture, inhabitants and their objects.","cited":44,"publisher":"OXFORD UNIV PRESS","year":2013,"volume":"18","issue":"3","pages":19},{"authors":"Choudhary, Neha; Sangra, Sonika","title":"Pattern of Tobacco consumption among urban slum population in Jammu region: A cross-sectional study","source":"JOURNAL OF FAMILY MEDICINE AND PRIMARY CARE","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"Introduction: Consumption of tobacco leads to a myriad of ill effects among the smokers as well as those in their proximity.

In Argentina, health information comes from the national risk factors survey (NRFS), which characterises the distribution of different risk factors. However, the NRFS has never collected information from residents living in slums, despite slums representing 10% of the population. The objective of this survey was to characterise the prevalence of cardiovascular and other risk factors among the inhabitants of one of the largest slums in Buenos Aires (Villa 31) and compare it to data from the NRFS. Study design: This was a cross-sectional study. Methods: A cross-sectional study was carried out in 400 slum households, using the same data structure as the NRFS. The survey obtained information about economic aspects, reproductive health, addictions and risk factors. All participants had their blood pressure, weight and height measured. A total of 406 people were interviewed and their data were compared with data from 32,365 people in the NRFS. All comparisons were made on the basis of age group. Results: A fair/poor self-perceived level of health (odds ratio [OR] 3.19, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.60-3.91), anxiety and moderate to severe depression (OR 5.44, 95% CI: 4.43-6.69), problem drinking (OR 10.01, 95% CI 8.08-12.40), self-reported hypertension (OR 1.26, 95% CI: 1.01-1.57), overweight (OR 1.26, 95% CI: 1.03-1.55) and obesity (OR 1.72, 95% CI: 1.38-2.15) were significantly higher in the slum population. In people aged 18-24 years, the prevalence of diabetes was triple the national average (OR 3.17, 95% CI: 1.26-7.98). For all evaluated conditions in this study, the inhabitants of the slum received significantly less treatment compared with participants from the NRFS. Conclusions: The prevalence of cardiovascular and other risk factors in the slum population has a different distribution to that reported in the NRFS.

We conducted a study in a non-notified slum of about 12,000 people in Mumbai to determine the prevalence of individuals at high risk for having a common mental disorder (i.e., depression and anxiety), to ascertain the impact of mental health on the burden of functional impairment, and to assess the influence of the slum environment on mental health. We gathered qualitative data (six focus group discussions and 40 individual interviews in July-November 2011), with purposively sampled participants, and quantitative data (521 structured surveys in February 2012), with respondents selected using community-level random sampling. For the surveys, we administered the General Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ) to screen for common mental disorders (CMDs), the WHO Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0 (WHO DAS) to screen for functional impairment, and a slum adversity questionnaire, which we used to create a composite Slum Adversity Index (SAI) score. Twenty-three percent of individuals have a GHQ score >= 5, suggesting they are at high risk for having a CMD. Psychological distress is a major contributor to the slum's overall burden of functional impairment. In a multivariable logistic regression model, household income, poverty-related factors, and the SAI score all have strong independent associations with CMD risk. The qualitative findings suggest that non-notified status plays a central role in creating psychological distress-by creating and exacerbating deprivations that serve as sources of stress, by placing slum residents in an inherently antagonistic relationship with the government through the criminalization of basic needs, and by shaping a community identity built on a feeling of social exclusion from the rest of the city.

Since direct measurement of indoor air pollution levels among the large slum population is infeasible, this study aims to develop predictive regression models for indoor PM2.5 and black carbon (BC) in the densely populated slums in Mumbai. Daily indoor PM2.5 and BC was measured inside the homes of a low-traffic slum (in 44 homes) and a high traffic slum (in 40 homes) during a winter season. Multivariable regression models were developed using measured indoor levels, publicly available ambient PM2.5 and information on local traffic characteristics, building characteristics and occupant activities (collected through questionnaire surveys). Models showed moderate to good performance for BC (adjusted R-2 = 0.50-0.64) and PM2.5 (adjusted R-2 = 0.53-0.57). Ambient PM2.5 was the most significant predictor for both pollutants, accounting for the temporal variation. BC was positively associated with the road length density of major roads while PM2.5 was associated with the density of all road types. Models for both pollutants were robust with Leave-One-Out-Cross-Validation (LOOCV) R-2 ranging 0.43-0.61 (BC) and 0.37-0.51 (PM2.5).

Respondents signed consent forms and their health conditions were documented based on self-reported history of diabetes, hypertension and family history using a semi-structured questionnaire. Diagnostic tests; weight and height for body mass index, blood glucose, and blood pressure were performed. Results: More than one quarter of the participants were suffering from hypertension and only half of this were diagnosed earlier, while a further few were already on treatment. Therefore on screening, it had been possible to diagnose over three hundred more respondents, who were not previously aware of their health status. The respondents' BMI showed that more than half of them were either overweight or obese and are at risk for diabetes, while 3.3% were confirmed as being diabetic, with their sugar levels greater than the normal range. Conclusion: This study therefore revealed the near absence of screening programs for chronic diseases such as hypertension, diabetes and obesity in these urban slums. This was further confirmed by the detection of new and undiagnosed cases of hypertension in about one quarter of the respondents.","funding":"International Association of National Public Health Institutes (IANPHI)","cited":13,"publisher":"IRANIAN SCIENTIFIC SOCIETY MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY","year":2013,"volume":"42","issue":"9","pages":8},{"authors":"Groot, Hilde E.; Muthuri, Stella K.","title":"Comparison of domains of self-reported physical activity between Kenyan adult urban-slum dwellers and national estimates","source":"GLOBAL HEALTH ACTION","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"Background: Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) - largely the result of modifiable behavioral risks such as physical inactivity that gradually develop into physiological risks - are a main cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. In Kenya, a nationally representative STEPwise survey of risk factors for NCDs established that 10.8% of Kenyans accumulated low levels of total physical activity. Objectives: The goal of our analyses was to compare domains of self-reported physical activity in two Nairobi slums to national estimates. Methods: Levels and time of self-reported activity in three domains (work, transport, and recreation), collected as part of a SCALE-UP study conducted in Korogocho and Viwandani slums in Nairobi, were compared to STEPwise findings. Results: The samples included a total of 10,128 participants (5,628 slum, 4,500 national). Only 7.1% and 4.0% of slum dwellers reported low levels of work and transport physical activity, respectively, but 95.9% reported low levels of recreation-related activity. Slum residents reported higher mean daily minutes of total activity than the national estimate (499 minutes versus 291 minutes), however, both samples spent similar proportions of total activity on work (79.0% slum, 78.3% national), transport (20.4% slum, 18.1% national), and recreation (0.6% slum, 3.6% national) activities. Conclusions: While the total amount of time spent in different domains of self-reported activity differs between urban slum residents and the national Kenyan population, proportions of time in each of the three domains are similar. It is important that such differences or similarities be considered when addressing NCD risk factors in these populations.","cited":16,"publisher":"TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","year":2017,"volume":"10","issue":"1","pages":7},{"authors":"Pyati, Ajit K.; Kamal, Ahmad M.","title":"Rethinking community and public space from the margins: a study of community libraries in Bangalore's slums","source":"AREA","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"The growth of slums in urban regions of the Global South is an issue of major concern for a variety of fields.

The difficulty arises from the highly contingent conceptualization of 'slum', as an agglomerate of poor seeking income. The paper investigates paradox of identity embedded in insecurities among ethnic migrants who lack recognition by the state and society. Data was collected using observation, in-depth interviews, and focus group discussions. Constant comparative method (CCM) together with thematic sampling was used for data analysis. The finding suggests that alienation of ethnic migrants is a consequence of constant negotiation of their identity in response to 'self-society-State'. It recommends slum to retain independent social space for ethnic community and society in a composite culture. To overcome the challenges of identity, income, and insecurity among ethnic migrants, the paper proposes a convergence model to integrate co-existence of multiple identities for public entitlements, welfare, and social acceptance.","cited":33,"publisher":"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","year":2019,"volume":"20","issue":"3","pages":14},{"authors":"van der Molen, P.","title":"Rapid urbanisation and slum upgrading: What can land surveyors do?","source":"SURVEY REVIEW","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"This paper aims at understanding the domain of rapid urbanisation and slum upgrading.

Reported death rates in the households per 1000 children (0-107 months) within the last year from the interview were 20.5 for boys and 27.0 for girls. More girls than boys died in infancy (age < 12 months). The most frequent reported causes of deaths were tetanus in infancy and diarrhoea among children aged less than or equal to 12 months. Vaccination coverage (DPT, polio, measles and BCG) was 73% for children < 3 years of age. The results showed that gender difference in mortality may have been influenced by the patterns of treatment received during sickness and the choice of treatment was determined by the financial ability of the households. Household income, children's vaccinations, TT immunization of mothers and personal cleanliness appeared to be significantly associated with child mortality. Despite the relatively high vaccination coverage for this population, child mortality remained alarmingly high, indicating that socioeconomic and environmental conditions must be improved to substantially reduce morbidity and mortality in this population.","cited":22,"publisher":"BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD","year":1999,"volume":"4","issue":"11","pages":7},{"authors":"Kshitij, Tamboli S.; Subhada, Avachat S.; Suchit, Tamboli S.","title":"UNMET NEED OF SEX EDUCATION AMONG ADOLESCENTS IN URBAN SLUM AREA: AN INTERVENTIONAL STUDY","source":"INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MEDICAL RESEARCH & HEALTH SCIENCES","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"Context: Adolescents comprise one-fifth of India's total population.

Subsequently, by posing questions to one another, a relational comparison of the trajectory of slum upgrading policy in each locality is composed, unearthing the political and institutional conditions that preceded the existence of the connection per se. In that sense, both eThekwini and Sao Paulo are considered equivalent starting points from which local actors engaged in circulating ideas and mobilised slum upgrading policies. This paper not only brings a fresh approach to comparative methods - incorporating political contexts and their extensive overlapping networks of relations alongside a focus on particular policy trajectories - but also contributes to furthering global urban studies in two other ways. First, it provides insight into the processes by which policies are put on the move and localised (or not). Second, it demonstrates how repeated instances of urban practice may be unravelled by allowing each context of policy formation, with its distinctive trajectory of slum upgrading, to speak to one another.

We then assess how these indicators can increase our understanding of slum settlements, analysing access to services in slums vs the remaining urban population for a subset of cities (Sao Paulo, Rio, Lima, Johannesburg, Mumbai, and Hyderabad). Significant gaps exist between the communities, especially when per capita indicators are compared. Finally, we analyse how these indicators can be used to scope the challenges of achieving universal access to basic services (e.g. water, electricity, and water collection) by 2030. The results show that large infrastructure investments or conservation efforts are needed, especially for solid waste collection and water provision in Mumbai and Hyderabad.

My ethnographic landscape is Sultanpur, a Muslim-dominated ghetto in the northern quarters of Hyderabad, which has been marked by decades of hostilities between local Hindus and Muslims. These tensions had everyday and extreme manifestations (ranging from quotidian expressions of symbolic violence to rioting, looting and bomb blasts) which increased the vulnerabilities of Muslim male children in the slums; the latter being humiliated by ordinary passers-by in times of peace, and at other times being attacked by rioting mobs. To counter their victimhood and organise their own retribution, sections of local boys in Sultanpur, aged between 9 and 14 years, co-ordinated themselves into child squads (bacchon ke fauj). These child vigilantes patrolled the slum borders and common public places, constantly establishing a disciplinary control over fragile aspects of ghetto life. For example, the male child squads not only aggressively prevented members of other communities from entering the slum, they also monitored the movement of Sultanpur-wallahs, often physically assaulting local women who were caught having affairs with Hindu men. In my paper I show how the power, presence and practices of these child squads upturned traditional structures of male and female authority, contested conventional notions of male childhood in a volatile urban space, and sustained nascent masculinities within the moral and social economy of impoverished Muslim male children.","cited":47,"publisher":"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","year":2011,"volume":"34","issue":"2","pages":22},{"authors":"Rains, Emily; Krishna, Anirudh; Wibbels, Erik","title":"Combining satellite and survey data to study Indian slums: evidence on the range of conditions and implications for urban policy","source":"ENVIRONMENT AND URBANIZATION","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"Projections suggest that most of the global growth in population in the next few decades will be in urban centres in Asia and Africa.

The low-income scenario makes it unique because the entire proposition is based on the importance of non-income drivers of appliance ownership that includes effects of changing the built environment (BE), household practices (HP) and appliances characteristics (AC). This study demonstrates quantitatively that non-income factors around energy practices influence appliance ownership, and therefore electricity consumption. The methodology consists of questionnaire design across the dimension of BE, HP and AC based on social practice theory, surveying of 1224 households and empirical analysis using covariance-based structural equation modelling. Results show that higher appliance ownership in the slum rehabilitation housing is due to change in household practice, built environment and affordability criteria of the appliances.

According to official statistics, there are 1,221 urban slum inhabited by 17 million people in Egypt. These urban slums suffer from deterioration in infrastructure; this includes lack of access to proper sanitation, inadequate water distribution networks and congested street networks. These issues in infrastructure systems are reflected on the social aspect and the quality of life in these areas with problems such as high crime rates, health problems and spread of epidemics. This study aims at presenting a solution model for improving the infrastructure networks in urban slums taking into consideration the urban, engineering and network design aspects. Suitable guidelines and bases of design are set in a solution model that can be revisited by studies and projects which encompasses infrastructure development in urban slums. The model considers different factors of social, economic and engineering aspects that may affect efficient and effective solutions. A case study presented in this study is Al-Sharabiya that is one of the low-income neighborhoods located in North Cairo. This neighborhood suffers severely from social, political and economic issues including uncontrolled population growth rates, low-income levels, high crime rates, drug abuse, high unemployment rates and deteriorated public services such as health, education, and transportation. The Egyptian Planning Authorities focused on this area and initiated an urban development and renewal project to enhance the urban fabric of the neighborhood. In this study the presented model is applied on the proposed urban development maps. The defined scope of this case study is divided into three main components for infrastructure systems design that encompasses transportation network planning and roads design, water distribution network, and sewage system network. The infrastructure systems are designed to improve the living conditions of the inhabitants of the neighborhood through providing adequate transportation, water and wastewater network systems.","cited":0,"publisher":"SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG","year":2018,"pages":35},{"authors":"Bag, Sugata; Seth, Suman","title":"Does It Matter How We Assess Standard of Living?

The migration and settlement of rural population to cities in search of earning avenues exposes them to several adverse environmental influences and alterations in lifestyle. There is a strong corelation between changing lifestyle factors and increase in prevalence of hypertension in India. Therefore, it is important to find out the prevalence and identify the risk factors of hypertension in the urban slums of Guwahati city, Assam. OBJECTIVES To assess the prevalence of hypertension and identify the associated risk factors among the adult population in the urban slums of Guwahati city, Assam. METHODOLOGY A cross-sectional study was conducted among 810 adults aged 18 years and above with detailed history followed by physical examination to evaluate various risk factors associated with hypertension. Data was analysed by using percentage for prevalence and Chi-square test was used to find out the association. RESULTS The overall prevalence of hypertension was 12.1%. The prevalence of hypertension among males and females was 12.98% and 11.27%, respectively. Factors such as age, occupation, tobacco use, salt consumption, family history of hypertension and BMI showed a statistically significant association. CONCLUSION The study shows a high prevalence of hypertension in the slum areas. The non-communicable disease strategy taking hypertension and cardiovascular diseases into consideration with extensive IEC activities regarding hypertension and its risk factors should be given priority in slum areas. Also opportunity for detection in individuals seeking health care and periodic screening of healthy individuals for early diagnosis and management should be done in these areas.","cited":14,"publisher":"JOURNAL EVOLUTION MEDICAL & DENTAL SCIENCES","year":2016,"volume":"5","issue":"72","pages":4},{"authors":"Rashid, Sabina Faiz","title":"Accessing married adolescent women: The realities of ethnographic research in an urban slum environment in Dhaka, Bangladesh","source":"FIELD METHODS","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"This article reports on the problem of obtaining reproductive histories from women in the slums of Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh.

Available statistical data are commonly aggregated to large, heterogeneous administrative units that are geographically meaningless for informing effective pro-poor policies. General base information neither allows spatially disaggregated analysis of deprived areas nor monitoring of rapidly changing settlement dynamics, which characterize slums. This paper explores the utility of the gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) variance to distinguish between slums and formal built-up (formal) areas in very high spatial and spectral resolution satellite imagery such as WorldView2, OrbView, Quickbird, and Resourcesat. Three geographically different cities are selected for this investigation: Mumbai and Ahmedabad, India and Kigali, Rwanda. The exploration of the utility and transferability of the GLCM shows that the variance of the GLCM combined with the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is able to separate slums and formal areas. The overall accuracy achieved is 84% in Kigali, 87% in Mumbai, and 88% in Ahmedabad. Furthermore, combining spectral information with the GLCM variance within a random forest classifier results in a pixel-based classification accuracy of 90%.

We compared families that moved from slums to public housing with those that remained living in slums in Santiago, Chile in terms of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) as main indicator of change. A cross-sectional study of 98 relocated families and 71 still living in slums was carried out, obtaining indoor and outdoor samples by a Personal Environmental Monitor. Home characteristics, including indoor air pollution sources were collected through questionnaires. Multivariate regression models included the intervention (public housing or slum), indoor pollution sources, outdoor PM2.5 and family characteristics as predictors. Indoor PM2.5 concentrations were higher in slums (77.8 mu g m(-3) [SD = 35.7 mu g m(-3)]) than in public housing (55.7 mu g m(-3) [SD = 34.6 mu g m(-3)], p < 0.001). Differences between indoor and outdoor PM2.5 were significant only in the slum houses. The multivariate analysis showed that housing intervention significantly decreased indoor PM2.5 (10.4 mu g m(-3)) after adjusting by the other predictors. Outdoor PM2.5 was the main predictor of indoor PM2.5. Other significant factors were water heating fuels and indoor smoking. Having infants 1-23 months was associated with a lowering of indoor PM2.5. Our results suggest that a public housing program that moves families from slums to public housing improves indoor air quality directly and also indirectly through air pollution sources.

Health-seeking behaviour becomes an important step towards maintaining a healthy life. The importance of contextual issues is necessary to help meet specific community health needs and programmes. Therefore, this study aims to bridge the knowledge gap by investigating health-seeking behaviour disparity among rural-urban labour migrant's slum dwellers before and after migration to the urban slums of Madina in the Greater Accra Region, Ghana. Design/methodology/approach The author used explanatory sequential approach of research investigation. Questionnaire and interview guides were used to collect data from the respondents however, in the absence of an existing reliable sampling frame, the various communities were selected by the use of cluster sampling proportional to size. At the second stage, a simple random sampling was used to select the various household heads. A total of 241 questionnaires were retrieved from the respondents representing a response rate of 100%. The author used purposive sampling technique to conduct eight in-depth interviews and six key informants' interviews. Findings The author found various discrepancies in many of the activities that could fulfil substantial health-seeking behaviour in the slum as compared to migrant's places of origin. The reason for coming to the slum amidst many settlements needs and low education background are the factors that accounted for this. This study, therefore, contradicts the proposition held by the health belief model. It is, therefore, important to note that contextual issues are key, in this case, rural-urban migrant slums present a different dynamic that must be taken into account when designing health programmes for such settings. Originality/value Many, if not all the, studies on health-seeking behaviour have focused on urban slums without taking into account urban migrants' slums. Such a failure to take into account the variations of the health needs of migrants' urban slum settings can eventually lead to a mismatch of health programmes meant to address their challenges. Therefore, this study brings to the fore such variations that must be taken into account when designing health programmes. The study also indicates that even with the same people, there were disparities in terms of health-seeking behaviour in the slum and at places of origin.","cited":59,"publisher":"EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD","year":2021,"volume":"121","issue":"4","pages":19},{"authors":"Kwiringira, Japheth; Atekyereza, Peter; Niwagaba, Charles; Guenther, Isabel","title":"Gender variations in access, choice to use and cleaning of shared latrines; experiences from Kampala Slums, Uganda","source":"BMC PUBLIC HEALTH","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"Background: Sanitation is one of the most intimate issues that affect women, especially in slums of developing countries. There are few studies that have paid attention to the gender variations in access, choice to use and cleaning of shared latrines in slums. Methods: This paper draws on qualitative data from a cross sectional study conducted between 2012 and 2013 in six slums of Kampala City, Uganda. The study involved both women and men. Data were collected from 12 Focus Group Discussions (FGDs), 15 Key informant interviews; community transects and photographs of shared latrines. Results: Location of a shared latrine facility, distance, filthy, narrow and irregular paths; the time when a facility is visited (day or night), privacy and steep inclines were gender 'filters' to accessing shared latrines. A full latrine pit was more likely to inhibit access to and choice of a facility for women than men. Results indicate that the available coping mechanisms turned out to be gendered, with fewer options available for women than men. On the whole, women sought for privacy, easy reach, self-respect and esteem, cleanliness and privacy than men. While men like women also wanted clean facilities for use; they (men) were not keen on cleaning these facilities. The cleaning of shared latrines was seen by both women and men as a role for women. Conclusion: The presence of sanitation facilities as the first step in the access, choice, use, and cleaning by both women and men has distinct motivations and limitations along gender lines. The study confirms that the use and cleaning of latrines is regulated by gender in daily living. Using a latrine for women was much more than relieving oneself: it involved security, intimacy and health concerns.","funding":"Centre for Development and Cooperation (NADEL) at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich (ETHZ); Department of Water and Sanitation in Developing Countries of the Swiss Aquatic Institute (EAWAG-SANDEC); Makerere University, College of Humanities and Social Sciences; Sustainable Sanitation and Water Renewal Systems (SSWARS) under European Water Initiative ERA-NET (SPLASH) Transnational Research on Sustainable Sanitation Service Chains ETH/EAWAG/ERANET/SPLASH/Makerere University","cited":67,"publisher":"BIOMED CENTRAL LTD","year":2014,"volume":"14","pages":11},{"authors":"da Silva, Madianita Nunes; Lemes da Silva, Marcelle Borges; Christine Mengarda Vasco, Kelly Maria; Schumacher Furlan, Debora Luiza; Texeira, Ana Gabriela; de Assis Correia, Alice Dandara","title":"Intervention in slums in the 1980s in Curitiba and the emergence of another paradigm in an embryonic stage","source":"URBE-REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE GESTAO URBANA","language":"Portuguese","doc":"Article","abstract":"The article analyzes the policy of intervention in slums in the Municipality of Curitiba in the 1980s, marked by the emergence of another paradigm, with the replacement of eradication by urbanization and land tenure regularization of the settlements.

Three characteristics seem to be crucial for this: first, trusting relationships between the people, which allows for a quick and unbureaucratic way to receive financial aid in form of small credits. In addition, the multifaceted and redundant structures of social capital, which allow numerous people to ask for help from people in varying positions.

Consequently, the study reported here hypothesized a negative or inverse relation between the variables at the inter-country level. The analysis uncovered evidence supporting the hypothesized link. The findings suggest as follows. Given two types of countries, 'A' and 'B,' where the former experienced more intense colonialism, while the latter was less intensively colonized, 'A' would have a lower incidence of slums than 'B.' Thus, the conclusion that colonialism is associated with less, and not more, slum incidence. This relationship, at least within the context of the study reported here, holds true whether colonialism is operationalized in terms of the duration of colonialism, the level of colonial investment or the extent of colonially-induced urbanization. The strongest predictor of slum incidence as revealed in the study is the duration of colonialism. The population size of the main colonial city in 1960 came in last as a predictor of this phenomenon. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Further, space constraints, violence, and overcrowding in slums make physical distancing and self-quarantine impractical, and the rapid spread of an infection highly likely. Residents of informal settlements are also economically vulnerable during any COVID-19 responses. Any responses to COVID-19 that do not recognize these realities will further jeopardize the survival of large segments of the urban population globally. Most top-down strategies to arrest an infectious disease will likely ignore the often-robust social groups and knowledge that already exist in many slums. Here, we offer a set of practice and policy suggestions that aim to (1) dampen the spread of COVID-19 based on the latest available science, (2) improve the likelihood of medical care for the urban poor whether or not they get infected, and (3) provide economic, social, and physical improvements and protections to the urban poor, including migrants, slum communities, and their residents, that can improve their long-term well-being. Immediate measures to protect residents of urban informal settlements, the homeless, those living in precarious settlements, and the entire population from COVID-19 include the following: (1) institute informal settlements/slum emergency planning committees in every urban informal settlement; (2) apply an immediate moratorium on evictions; (3) provide an immediate guarantee of payments to the poor; (4) immediately train and deploy community health workers; (5) immediately meet Sphere Humanitarian standards for water, sanitation, and hygiene; (6) provide immediate food assistance; (7) develop and implement a solid waste collection strategy; and (8) implement immediately a plan for mobility and health care. Lessons have been learned from earlier pandemics such as HIV and epidemics such as Ebola. They can be applied here. At the same time, the opportunity exists for public health, public administration, international aid, NGOs, and community groups to innovate beyond disaster response and move toward long-term plans.","funding":"ESRCUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC) [ES/S00811X/1] Funding Source: UKRI; NCATS NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) [UL1 TR001863] Funding Source: Medline","cited":82,"publisher":"SPRINGER","year":2020,"volume":"97","issue":"3","pages":10},{"authors":"Banerjee, Shashwati; Goswami, Kishor","title":"Self-employed or paid employed: Who can earn more among the slum dwellers and why?","source":"PROGRESS IN DEVELOPMENT STUDIES","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"Past literature in the context of slum dwellers rarely acknowledges the occupational variation in informal job types.

Many studies have reported a positive association between BMI and socioeconomic status (SES). However, an in-depth investigation of the relationship between BMI and wealth index is lacking for urban slum settings. Objective To examine the association between BMI and wealth index in an urban slum setting in Nairobi, Kenya. Methods A total of 2003 adults between 40 and 60 years of age were included. BMI was derived from direct weight and height measurements. Wealth Index was computed using the standard principal component analysis of household amenities ownership. The relationship between BMI and wealth index was assessed using both linear and logistic regression models. Results We found that BMI linearly increased across the five quintiles of wealth index in both men and women, after adjusting for potential confounding factors. The prevalence of obesity increased from 10% in the first wealth quintile to 26.2% in the fifth wealth quintile. The average BMI for women entered the overweight category at the second quintile wealth status, or the third quintile for the total population. Conclusion There exists a strong positive relationship between BMI and wealth index in slum settings. Health promotion interventions aimed at reducing obesity may consider using wealth index in priority setting.","funding":"National Institute of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [U54HG006938]; NATIONAL HUMAN GENOME RESEARCH INSTITUTEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) [U54HG006938] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","cited":26,"publisher":"CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS","year":2018,"volume":"3","pages":8},{"authors":"de Araujo, Arthur Filipe; Vieira, Armando Luis; Costa, Carlos","title":"Developing a Model of Film-Induced Slum Tourism Motivations: an Exploratory, Qualitative Approach","source":"PROCEEDINGS OF THE 13TH EUROPEAN CONFERENCE ON INNOVATION AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP (ECIE 2018)","language":"English","doc":"Proceedings Paper","abstract":"Film tourism encompasses visits to places whose attractiveness is related to audio-visual products (films, tv-series, soap operas...). There is a wide range of studies acknowledging those products' potential to influence destination image, visit motivations, and, consequently, tourist arrivals to the depicted places. Destination managers and tourism entrepreneurs have increasingly made efforts to capitalise on this potential. In academia, the phenomenon has motivated a growing body of work on the relationship between cinema and tourism. The literature suggests that even films that portray destinations under a bad light can increase motivations to visit them. Such conclusions, strengthened by several real-world cases, imply that films might play a special role in inducing motivations for slum tourism, which is described as tourism to which poverty is part of the attraction. Slum tourism has received little academic attention from the perspective of tourism studies, and research on film tourists' motivations is particularly scarce. The few indications available in the literature are either initial insights or assumptions and premises subjectively made by their authors. In this context, the present study aims at developing a model including the dimensions of slum tourism motivations, and the film elements that act as their determinants. To this end, an exploratory, qualitative approach was employed, based on the empirical data collected with the participation of tourists visiting the favelas of Rio de Janeiro. Results show that slum tourism motivations include Learning motivations and Experiential motivations as push factors, and that each of those dimensions is affected by two categories of film pull factors: Place & Personality, and Performance. The model is expected to work as an innovative tool for increasing destination attractiveness, and the effectiveness of managerial practices. In addition, it constitutes a first step towards a structural analysis of slum tourism motivations and their film determinants. The present investigation thus provides relevant theoretical and managerial insights, as well as important avenues for future research.","cited":23,"publisher":"ACAD  CONFERENCES LTD","year":2018,"pages":9},{"authors":"Subbaraman, Ramnath; O'Brien, Jennifer; Shitole, Tejal; Shitole, Shrutika; Sawant, Kiran; Bloom, David E.; Patil-Deshmukh, Anita","title":"Off the map: the health and social implications of being a non-notified slum in India","source":"ENVIRONMENT AND URBANIZATION","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"Approximately half of all slums((1)) in India are not recognized by the government. Lack of government recognition, also referred to as non-notified status in the Indian context, may create entrenched barriers to legal rights and basic services such as water, sanitation and security of tenure.

We illustrate this relationship using the findings of a four-year long series of studies in the community. By comparing Kaula Bandar's statistics with those from other Mumbai slums captured by India's National Family Health Survey-3, we show that Kaula Bandar has relative deficiencies in several health and social outcomes, including educational status, child health and adult nutrition. We then provide an explanatory framework for the role that Kaula Bandar's non-notified status may play in generating poor health outcomes, by discussing the health consequences of the absence of basic services. We also highlight the criminalization by the government of activities necessary for fulfilling access to fundamental needs such as water, toilets and shelter. We argue that the policy vacuum surrounding non-notified slums such as Kaula Bandar results in governance failures that lead to poor health outcomes. Our findings highlight the need for cities in India and other developing countries to establish and fulfill minimum humanitarian standards in non-notified slums for the provision of basic services such as water, sanitation, solid waste removal, electricity and education.","funding":"FIC NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Fogarty International Center (FIC) [R24 TW007988] Funding Source: Medline; FOGARTY INTERNATIONAL CENTERUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Fogarty International Center (FIC) [R24TW007988] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","cited":32,"publisher":"SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD","year":2012,"volume":"24","issue":"2","pages":21},{"authors":"Chandrasekhar, S.; Mitra, Arup","title":"Migration, caste and livelihood: evidence from Indian city-slums","source":"URBAN RESEARCH & PRACTICE","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"This paper based on a primary survey of slum dwellers in four Indian cities examines the caste dimension of migrants and the nexus, if any, between caste and the job market participation.

The disadvantaged castes are not even in a position to take the benefits of migration. Further, those with higher caste status seem to have better endowments required for absorption in the urban job market; the migrants of higher caste status are absorbed in relatively better jobs compared to the lower castes. Migrant workers from GEN category draw relatively higher incomes. On the whole, when both the caste and migration dimensions are combined, at the lower echelons, migration does pay if the worker is better off in terms of caste status. From this point of view, it is argued that special programmes offering improved access to livelihood opportunities need to be pursued in the rural areas so that the disadvantaged castes are able to reduce their vulnerability.","cited":18,"publisher":"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","year":2019,"volume":"12","issue":"2","pages":17},{"authors":"Williams, Glyn; Omankuttan, Umesh; Devika, J.; Aasen, Berit","title":"Enacting participatory, gender-sensitive slum redevelopment?

It does so by examining Indian national slum redevelopment policy and its implementation in Kerala's capital city, Trivandrum (Thiruvananthapuram). Kerala's track-record of participatory governance and the lead role given to its women-focused poverty alleviation mission, Kudumbashree, in implementing housing projects make it an ideal place in which to examine these questions, and their gender implications. Primary data focusing on two housing projects are used to contrast intended governance changes featuring female-centred community participation with their actual operation on the ground. Despite moves to foreground women's engagement, both projects suffered from shortfalls in institutional design, the inevitable administrative complexity of housing delivery, and resistance from local power brokers. Given Kerala's favourable starting conditions, these outcomes highlight the need for slum redevelopment to be based around a deeper analysis of power dynamics and the explicit articulation of an agenda for inclusion at a city-level if participation is to realise its transformative potential.","funding":"Norwegian Research CouncilResearch Council of NorwayEuropean Commission [RCN-217185]","cited":56,"publisher":"PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD","year":2018,"volume":"96","pages":10},{"authors":"Parikh, H.; Parikh, P.","title":"Slum networking - A paradigm shift to transcend poverty with water, environmental sanitation and hidden resources","source":"WATER AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT PARADIGMS: TOWARDS AN INTEGRATION OF ENGINEERING, DESIGN AND MANAGEMENT APPROACHES","language":"English","doc":"Proceedings Paper","abstract":"This paper explores an alternative development paradigm which shifts from the present 'social paternalism' to the one which uses water and environmental sanitation infrastructure to alleviate poverty.

By using microdata, this article aims to study the impact of basic services on rental value in the slums of Abidjan (Ivory Coast). Several reasons make our study original. First, we use the theoretical model of hedonic prices which allows us to measure the valuation of basic services in rental value. Next, our study grounds in a household survey data that we collected in 2014 in the slums of Abidjan. Finally, we focus on several basic services: water, sanitation, electricity and waste collection. Our results highlight facts which contribute to the literature on property valuation on Sub-Saharan countries. As expected, we find that the rental price of housing with improved access on sanitation, connected to the water network and/or electricity, is relatively higher. However and against all odds, the presence of organized waste collection has no impact on these rental values. Indeed, this service is not organized because it can be offered either by formal or informal operators according to the districts of Abidjan. Furthermore, precollectors working conditions are often poor and their service are not always continuous. In this context, our study is a first attempt to assess the benefits that households associate with this service. It is likely that households underestimate the benefits and we could expect that the access to organized waste collection lead to a better rental value if they would be more aware of this service importance.","cited":60,"publisher":"ARMAND COLIN","year":2020,"issue":"5","pages":29},{"authors":"Adubofour, Kwame; Obiri-Danso, Kwasi; Quansah, Charles","title":"Sanitation survey of two urban slum Muslim communities in the Kumasi metropolis, Ghana","source":"ENVIRONMENT AND URBANIZATION","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"The Millennium Development Goals call for a 50 per cent reduction in the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water and sanitation.

In India, a number of slum upgrading schemes have been implemented over the last decades aiming at better living conditions. However, these schemes rarely consider improvement in liveability as an explicit criterion, assuming that better physical conditions and the provision of basic services inevitably lead to better liveability. We use Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs) to analyse liveability in four different informal settlements in Pune (India). We compare the liveability by conducting semi-structured interviews with residents and by analysing them in individual and aggregated FCMs. Each settlement represents an archetypical form of the upgradation process: non-upgraded (base case), in-situ upgraded, relocated, and temporary resettlement. The FCMs show that the liveability indicators availability of community space, proximity to public transportation, feeling of belonging, and good relationship with neighbours and community are central elements of these neighbourhoods' liveability. The results suggest that upgradation may lead to an improved overall liveability but can also reduce it if not designed properly. The fostering of community agency, an integration of the neighbourhood into the formal city fabric, and the maintaining of cohesion during the shift from horizontal to vertical living emerged as critical factors. To ensure sustainable integration of liveability considerations in slum upgrading schemes, we suggest using indicators well-adapted to the local context, co-created with local experts and stakeholders, as well as periodic post-occupancy liveability evaluations.","funding":"US National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [ICER/EAR-1829999]; Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF) [033WU002]","cited":55,"publisher":"MDPI","year":2021,"volume":"5","issue":"2","pages":20},{"authors":"Madise, Nyovani J.; Ziraba, Abdhalah K.; Inungu, Joseph; Khamadi, Samoel A.; Ezeh, Alex; Zulu, Eliya M.; Kebaso, John; Okoth, Vincent; Mwau, Matilu","title":"Are slum dwellers at heightened risk of HIV infection than other urban residents?

Data was summarized using frequencies for categorical data and medians for continuous data. Results: Majority of the participants (71.9%) were >= 25years with a mean age of 28.0(SD +/- 7.0) years. The commonest symptoms known to the participants were genital itching (60%) and genital rash (14.5%). Most mentioned multiple partners (63.7%) and unprotected sex (50.7%) as predisposing factors to STIs. Knowledge on methods of prevention was high (92.3%) however, 18.8% were found positive for STIs using the syndromic approach and 82% mentioned having suffered from STIs in the past 6 months more than once. Conclusion: Most participants did not know about the systemic effects of STIs to their health and didnot follow the appropriate behavior patterns despite being knowledgeable about the various methods of prevention of STIs.","funding":"MEPI MESAU (MESAU-MEPI programmatic Award) from Forgaty international center [IR24TW008886]; FOGARTY INTERNATIONAL CENTERUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Fogarty International Center (FIC) [R24TW008886] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","cited":19,"publisher":"MAKERERE UNIV, FAC MED","year":2016,"volume":"16","issue":"1","pages":7},{"authors":"Sumargo, Bagus; Akbar, Zarina; Wibowo, Agus","title":"Assessment of Household Happiness in Slum Environment Using the Expected Value Rules","source":"PERTANIKA JOURNAL OF SOCIAL SCIENCE AND HUMANITIES","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"A slum environment is an area that commonly has characteristics of unhealthy house conditions and tends to create a crowded condition among residents.

Slum residents form a significant portion of urban populations and contribute to the development of cities. However, due to their highly concentrated consumption and waste production patterns, slums endure and exacerbate, among other things, environmental degradation. To date, our understanding of slums in Indian cities has been primarily based on census data and evidence from remote sensing images. These data do not yet provide spatial slum dynamics over time and are limited to static and statistical representation. In addition to the obsolescence of spatial data, the non-availability of consistent socioeconomic data leads to data integration problems. Therefore, new approaches that consider the scarcity of data and the choice of analytical techniques are needed; planners without advanced technical training should also be able to easily apply these approaches. This study provides a comprehensive approach to examine the urban transformation of the National Capital Territory of Delhi (NCT-Delhi), India, from 1971 to 2011. Combining data from multi-temporal remote sensing images, census population statistics, slum enumeration and the provision of essential services, these investigations reveal a previously undocumented rapid increase in built-up areas outside municipal boundaries. The findings confirm the spatial shift of slums from the city center towards the periphery. The analysis provides a revealing insight: the emergence and growth of slums are outcomes of the prevailing urban planning environment, the limited success of adopted policies and the government's inability to foster growth.

During the summer of 2019, indoor temperature, humidity and heat stress index were monitored every 10 min over a 24-h period in 123 slum dwellings in Kolkata and in 101 rural village houses located about 75 km south of Kolkata; and compared to outdoor measurements. Most dwellings exhibited indoor conditions that were above those considered safe for occupants at some point during the day. However, under similar outdoor conditions, indoor heat stress was greater and more prolonged in Kolkata slum dwellings than in rural village houses. The coolest dwellings were constructed of mud walls and thatch roofs in the village, and the hottest dwellings were constructed of cement walls and clay tile or corrugated tin roofs in Kolkata. In the Kolkata slums, the duration of dangerous heat stress during the day was inversely related to the number of rooms in a dwelling, and positively related to the number of occupants. Binary logistic regression analysis showed that crowding and construction materials in Kolkata slums contribute to dangerous indoor HSI levels even at relatively low outdoor maximum temperatures.

Slum rehabilitation in Mumbai is a hallmark example of a participatory process which is supposed to improve the quality of life and well-being among the rehabilitated occupants, on paper. Yet our findings show that the key stakeholders' (i.e. policymaker, architect, management co-operatives and female occupants) sentiments are worlds apart. This gap evokes a need for a more systematic framework for a participatory approach. Verbal communication has the power to implicitly decipher the common emotion or sentiment regarding infrastructure or its related policy. This study uses a quasi-qualitative approach to understand the underlying concerns of gender mainstreaming in slum rehabilitation housing (SRH) management in Mumbai, India. Verbal narratives from semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions are used to explore the concerns of the stake-holders. Sentiment analysis using the machine learning technique of Natural Language Processing (NLP) is used to decode the emotions across the stakeholders. The results indicate that gender inequality in SRH is propagated through lack of communication and the different vocabulary used by the female occupants and the apex policymakers. There are also remarkable differences between male- and female-led co-operatives who are in charge of SRH management. Female-led co-operatives were observed to go beyond basic maintenance duties, to reduce debt and monthly fees and to take up incremental improvements such as decorative elements or installation of solar panels. This participation required a full female body co-operative rather than partial female representation in order to be effective. This study suggests that gender mainstreaming is important not only in SRH design but also in maintenance and that exploring the sentiments of the key stakeholders, as proposed in our analysis, could mitigate undesirable effects of SRH and enable the participatory process.","funding":"British Academy Knowledge Frontiers programme [KF1/100033]; Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD), the Government of India (GoI) [RD/0114-MHRD0A0-025]; IRCC-Indian Institute of Technology Bombay Fund [RD/0516-IRCCSHO-032]","cited":83,"publisher":"PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD","year":2019,"volume":"92","pages":19},{"authors":"Banerjee, Shashwati; Goswami, Kishor","title":"The occupational illness of slum dwellers across industries: A case study in West Bengal","source":"INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ERGONOMICS","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"Better livelihood of the slum dwellers necessitates analyzing the health status of the primary industrial earners upon whom the needs of the whole family rely.

Nearly one-third of the world's population and more than 60% of urban populations in the least developed countries live in slums, including hundreds of millions of children. Slums are areas of broad social and health disadvantage to children and their families due to extreme poverty, overcrowding, poor water and sanitation, substandard housing, limited access to basic health and education services, and other hardships (eg, high unemployment, violence). Despite the magnitude of this problem, very little is known about the potential impact of slum life on the health of children and adolescents. Statistics that show improved mortality and health outcomes in cities are based on aggregated data and may miss important intraurban disparities. Limited but consistent evidence suggests higher infant and under-five years mortality for children residing in slums compared with non-slum areas. Children suffer from higher rates of diarrhoeal and respiratory illness, malnutrition and have lower vaccination rates. Mothers residing in slums are more poorly educated and less likely to receive antenatal care and skilled birth assistance. Adolescents have earlier sexual debut and higher rates of HIV, and adopt risky behaviours influenced by their social environment. We also know little about the consequences of this form of early childhood on long-term health-related behaviour (eg, diet and exercise) and non-communicable disease outcomes, such as obesity, heart disease and mental illness. Further attention to understanding and addressing child health in slum settings is an important priority for paediatricians and those committed to child health worldwide.","cited":78,"publisher":"BMJ PUBLISHING GROUP","year":2013,"volume":"98","issue":"10","pages":7},{"authors":"Thomson, Dana R.; Kuffer, Monika; Boo, Gianluca; Hati, Beatrice; Grippa, Tais; Elsey, Helen; Linard, Catherine; Mahabir, Ron; Kyobutungi, Catherine; Maviti, Joshua; Mwaniki, Dennis; Ndugwa, Robert; Makau, Jack; Sliuzas, Richard; Cheruiyot, Salome; Nyambuga, Kilion; Mboga, Nicholus; Kimani, Nicera Wanjiru; de Albuquerque, Joao Porto; Kabaria, Caroline","title":"Need for an Integrated Deprived Area Slum Mapping System (IDEAMAPS) in Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs)","source":"SOCIAL SCIENCES-BASEL","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"Ninety percent of the people added to the planet over the next 30 years will live in African and Asian cities, and a large portion of these populations will reside in deprived neighborhoods defined by slum conditions, informal settlement, or inadequate housing.

A four-item scale was adapted from the U. S. six-item short-form food security scale and was administered in Hindi through household interviews with 410 female adults. Association of HFI with household economic and socio-demographic characteristics were examined using multiple logistic regression. Cronbach's alpha and Rasch-model-based item fit statistics were used to assess reliability and internal validity. Fifty-one percent of households were food insecure.

However, there has been very limited action research to reduce the pollution load from uncontrolled grey water discharge by households in urban slums. This study was therefore carried out to investigate the potential of a two-step filtration process to reduce the grey water pollution load in an urban slum using a crushed lava rock filter, to determine the main filter design and operation parameters and the effect of intermittent flow on the grey water effluent quality. A two-step crushed lava rock filter unit was designed and implemented for use by a household in the Bwaise III slum in Kampala city (Uganda). It was monitored at a varying hydraulic loading rate (HLR) of 0.5-1.1 m d(-1) as well as at a constant HLR of 0.39 m d(-1). The removal efficiencies of COD, TP and TKN were, respectively, 85.9%, 58% and 65.5% under a varying HLR and 90.5%, 59.5% and 69%, when operating at a constant HLR regime. In addition, the log removal of Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp. and total coliforms was, respectively, 3.8, 3.2 and 3.9 under the varying HLR and 3.9, 3.5 and 3.9 at a constant HLR. The results show that the use of a two-step filtration process as well as a lower constant HLR increased the pollutant removal efficiencies.

Neo-slumming and gentrification as a tourism resource","source":"INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TOURISM CITIES","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to analyse urban transformation as a tourism resource. Tourism is undeniably a powerful motor for urban transformation but in return, urban transformation can represent a resource for actors related to tourism. More precisely this paper focuses on one major transformation of modern cities: gentrification. Design/methodology/approach - The central hypothesis of this paper is that gentrification accompanies tourism, but that gentrification itself may also become an object of the tourist gaze. The paper focuses on local guides and small touristic entrepreneurs in order to identify the tensions that might arise. The presentation of two guided tours - Subculture Brixton Nightlife Tour and Where Brooklyn At? - will enable us to explore how the gentrification of Brixton (London) and Brooklyn (New York) may be used as a tourism resource for local private entrepreneurs. Findings - Results presented here are based on ethnographic methods such as observation as well as content analysis and semi-directive interviews. Mobilising the historical concept of slumming, this paper proposes an extended conceptual framework, neo-slumming, to analyse evolving tourism practices in modern cities, practices that are considered here as tourism's new frontiers. Originality/value - However, as tourism transforms cities, the process itself is now of interest to tourists and thus becomes a resource for sector businesses (Naef, 2018). Yet studies about the touristification of urban transformation are still quite rare. This analysis aims to fill this gap by looking at the way a process, such as some spectacular, rapid or radical transformation of the urban fabric, can become a touristic resource associated with specific narratives and representations. In this context, the tourist gaze (Urry, 2002) is directed on a resource characterised by its ongoing change.","cited":50,"publisher":"EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD","year":2019,"volume":"5","issue":"3","pages":16},{"authors":"Deo, Richa; Walvekar, Padmaja Ravindra; Mallapur, Mahesh D.","title":"Factors Associated with Domestic Violence among Married Women Residing in an Urban Slum","source":"JOURNAL OF THE SCIENTIFIC SOCIETY","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"Background: Domestic violence against women is a major public health problem leading to violation of women's human right.

The type of domestic violence and reasons for it differ depending on the associated risk factors. Most commonly seen risk factors are low level of education of both wife and husband, poverty, harmful use of alcohol by husband, and accepting violence as male privilege etcetera.

This increased rural-urban migration, coupled with housing poverty, has led to the growth and formation of informal settlements, commonly known as slums. In Mexico, 25% of the urban population now live in informal settlements with varying degrees of deprivation. Although some informal neighbourhoods have contributed to the upward mobility of the inhabitants, the majority still lack basic services. Mexico City and the conurbation around it form a mega city of 21million people that has been growing in a manner qualified as 'highly unproductive, (that) deepens inequality, raises pollution levels' (available at: ) and contains the largest slum in the world: Neza-Chalco-Izta. Urban reforms are now aiming to improve the conditions in these slums and therefore it is very important to have reliable tools to measure the changes that are underway. In this paper, we use exploratory factor analysis to define an index of shelter deprivation in Mexico City, namely the Slum Severity Index (SSI), based on the UN-HABITAT's definition of slum. We apply this novel approach to the Census survey of Mexico and measure the shelter deprivation levels of households from 1990 to 2010. The analysis highlights high variability in housing conditions within Mexico City. We find that the SSI decreased significantly between 1990 and 2000 as a result of several policy reforms but increased between 2000 and 2010. We also show correlations of the SSI with other social factors such as education, health and fertility. We present a validation of the SSI using Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) features extracted from Very-High Resolution (VHR) remote-sensed satellite images. Finally, we show that the SSI can present a cardinally meaningful assessment of the extent of deprivation compared with a similar index defined by Connolly (Connolly P (2009) Observing the evolution of irregular settlements: Mexico city's colonias populares, 1990 to 2005.

This study provides the first quantitative assessment of spatial and seasonal variation of outdoor BC and PM2.5 concentrations in several densely populated slums of Mumbai, India. Mobile outdoor real-time BC and PM2.5 monitoring was conducted along pre-designed monitoring routes in seven slums in Mumbai during the summer (May-June 2015 and May 2016) and repeated in four of them during the winter (February 2016). The measurements were repeated on the routes during different hours and days to account for the temporal variability of air pollution (n(summer)= 80 trips; n(winter)= 48 trips). PM2.5 exhibited homogenous distribution inside each slum (coefficient of divergence (COD) = 0.11-0.23), while BC varied significantly showing increasing concentrations with proximity to major roads (COD = 0.26-0.64). BC/PM2.5 ratio, an indicator of impact of traffic emissions, was higher along major roads of all slums (14-43%) and minor roads and alleys of high-traffic slums (10-17%) while lowest along alleys and minor roads of low-traffic slums (7-11%). Comparison of pollutant concentrations among major roads revealed the dominant effect of emissions from heavy-duty vehicles and traffic congestion. Significantly high concentrations were observed during winter season compared with summer for both PM2.5(125 +/- 46 mu g m(-3)in winter and 41 +/- 25 mu g m(-3)in summer) and BC (12 +/- 6 mu g m(-3) in winter and 7 +/- 6 mu g m(-3) in summer). The results of this study indicate that slum residents in Mumbai and similar slums around the world are at a higher risk of traffic-related air pollution, with risk being more severe in winters due to poorer dispersion conditions. Our findings suggest that targeted mitigation strategies to reduce vehicular emissions, especially in high-traffic slums, would yield required benefits.","funding":"IRCC, IIT Bombay [RD/0516-IRCCSH0-008]; MHRD [RD/0114IMHPC06-003]","cited":58,"publisher":"SPRINGER HEIDELBERG","year":2021,"volume":"28","issue":"2","pages":12},{"authors":"Joshi, Ashish; Malhotra, Bhavya; Amadi, Chioma; Loomba, Menka; Misra, Archa; Sharma, Shruti; Arora, Arushi; Amatya, Jaya","title":"Gender and the Digital Divide Across Urban Slums of New Delhi, India: Cross-Sectional Study","source":"JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"Background: Disparities in access to specific technologies within gender groups have not been investigated. Slum settings provide an ideal population to investigate the contributing factors to these disparities. Objective: This study aimed to examine gender differences in mobile phone ownership, internet access, and knowledge of SMS text messaging among males and females living in urban slum settings. Methods: A convenience sampling approach was used in sample selection from 675 unnotified slums. A total of 38 slum sites were then selected across four geographic zones. Of these, 10% of the households in each slum site was selected from each zone. One household member was interviewed based on their availability and fulfillment of the eligibility criteria. Eligible individuals included those aged 18 years and above, residing in these slums, and who provided voluntary consent to participate in the study. Individuals with mental or physical challenges were excluded from the study. Results: Our results showed that females were half as likely to own mobile phones compared with males (odds ratio [OR] 0.53, 95% CI 0.37-0.76), less likely to have internet access (OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.56-1.11), or know how to send text messages (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.66-1.31). The predictors of mobile phone ownership, internet access, and text messaging between males and females included age, individual education, housing type, and the number of earning members in a household in the adjusted analysis. Among males, the number of earning members was a predictor of both mobile phone ownership and text messaging, whereas household education was a predictor of both internet access and text messaging. Age and individual education only predicted internet access, whereas housing type only predicted text messaging. Among females, household education was a predictor of all the technology outcomes. Age and type of toilet facility only predicted mobile phone ownership; housing type only predicted internet access whereas television ownership with satellite service and smoking behavior only predicted text messaging. Conclusions: Our study findings showing disparate access to technology within gender groups lend support for further research to examine the causal mechanisms promoting these differences to proffer significant solutions. Specifically, our study findings suggest that improving household education is crucial to address the disparate access and usage of mobile phones, the internet, and text messaging among women in slum settings. This suggestion is due to the consistency in household educational level as a predictor across all these technology indicators. In addition, the mechanisms by which the number of household earning members influences the disparate access to technology among men call for further exploration.","cited":19,"publisher":"JMIR PUBLICATIONS, INC","year":2020,"volume":"22","issue":"6","pages":17},{"authors":"Linke, Uli","title":"Mobile Imaginaries, Portable Signs: Global Consumption and Representations of Slum Life","source":"TOURISM GEOGRAPHIES","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"This essay explores how iconic representations of slum life are produced for transnational consumption in Europe.

Yet, while the country is nearing universal primary school enrolment, drop-out rates remain high - and learning levels are poor. Urbanisation, one of the engines of Bangladesh's development, has gone hand-in-hand with the rapid growth of urban slums, where child labour is rife. This paper describes the results of a unique, large-scale representative survey into the relationship between child labour and education in slums of Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh. The survey covers 2700 households drawn from a listing of 4500, with children and their parents responding to a detailed questionnaire. We report a number of findings that differ from those emerged from previous research and national surveys. First, there is a high work incidence among children aged 6-14, with an average rate of 15% reported across our survey sites. Second, in contrast to previous studies, the overwhelming majority of working children are out-of-school. Third, almost all working children are involved in what both International Labour Organization (ILO) Conventions and national legislation would categorise as child labour, with hazardous work figuring prominently. Fourth, the ready-made garments sector appears to be a major employer of children, accounting for two thirds of female child labour. The education system contributes to the child labour problem by creating a 'supply' of potential recruits. Late entry to school, grade repetition and poor-quality education all serve to push children out of education and into employment. One of the take-home messages of this research is that Bangladesh will not achieve the 2030 development goals on education without strengthened commitment to eradicate child labour; and the country will not eradicate child labour without making education compulsory and free for the 6-14 age group.","cited":33,"publisher":"ELSEVIER","year":2019,"volume":"13","pages":17},{"authors":"Heathcott, Joseph","title":"National programs and local agendas in the movement to clear the slums, 1942-1952","source":"JOURNAL OF URBAN HISTORY","language":"English","doc":"Article; Proceedings Paper","abstract":"The case of St. Louis in the 1940s demonstrates the central importance of this decade in American urban history.

The analysis shows that successful outcomes are intrinsically tied to the manner in which the upgrade process is implemented.

The case of Shivajinagar-Bainganwadi reveals that the neighborhood's emergence as an illegal slum has been mediated by the liberalization-era politics that have come to infuse the neighborhood's water pipes dynamics that have produced the illegality/informality of the neighborhood as a discursive effect.","cited":44,"publisher":"WILEY","year":2014,"volume":"38","issue":"1","pages":24},{"authors":"Abuya, Benta A.; Ciera, James; Kimani-Murage, Elizabeth","title":"Effect of mother's education on child's nutritional status in the slums of Nairobi","source":"BMC PEDIATRICS","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"Background: Malnutrition continues to be a critical public health problem in sub-Saharan Africa. For example, in East Africa, 48 % of children under-five are stunted while 36 % are underweight. Poor health and poor nutrition are now more a characteristic of children living in the urban areas than of children in the rural areas. This is because the protective mechanism offered by the urban advantage in the past; that is, the health benefits that historically accrued to residents of cities as compared to residents in rural settings is being eroded due to increasing proportion of urban residents living in slum settings. This study sought to determine effect of mother's education on child nutritional status of children living in slum settings. Methods: Data are from a maternal and child health project nested within the Nairobi Urban Health and Demographic Surveillance System (NUHDSS). The study involves 5156 children aged 0-42 months. Data on nutritional status used were collected between October 2009 and January 2010. We used binomial and multiple logistic regression to estimate the effect of education in the univariable and multivariable models respectively. Results: Results show that close to 40 % of children in the study are stunted. Maternal education is a strong predictor of child stunting with some minimal attenuation of the association by other factors at maternal, household and community level. Other factors including at child level: child birth weight and gender; maternal level: marital status, parity, pregnancy intentions, and health seeking behaviour; and household level: social economic status are also independently significantly associated with stunting. Conclusion: Overall, mothers' education persists as a strong predictor of child's nutritional status in urban slum settings, even after controlling for other factors. Given that stunting is a strong predictor of human capital, emphasis on girl-child education may contribute to breaking the poverty cycle in urban poor settings.","funding":"Wellcome TrustWellcome TrustEuropean Commission [078530/Z/05/Z]; Rockefeller Foundation","cited":35,"publisher":"BMC","year":2012,"volume":"12","pages":10},{"authors":"Montaner, Josep Maria","title":"Remaking Slums: International Examples of Upgrading Neighbourhoods","source":"BUILDINGS","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"The slum, self-constructed houses and neighbourhoods, signifies the dwelling and home for a very representative part of humanity.

Although cleaner fuels are available, some households continue using solid fuels because of financial constraints and absence of infrastructure, especially in non-notified slums. The present study documents a randomised controlled study investigating the efficacy of improved cookstove on the personal exposure to air pollution and the respiratory health of women and children in an Indian slum. The improved cookstove was based on co-creation of a low-smoke chulha with local communities in order to support adaption and sustained uptake. Methods: The study will be conducted in a non-notified slum called Ashrayanagar in Bangalore, India. The study design will be a 1: 1 randomised controlled intervention trial, including 250 households. The intervention group will receive an improved cookstove (low-smoke chulha) and the control group will continue using either the traditional cookstove (chulha) or a combination of the traditional stove and the kerosene/ diesel stove.

The current approach to TB case detection does not reach millions of people. Poor and vulnerable people cannot access health facilities due to barriers such as financial, geographical and cultural. Poor diagnostic services, ineffective screening, drop-out during diagnostic process and substandard care outside of the NTP make the situation worse. In Myanmar, TB prevalence is higher in urban than in rural areas (330.7 vs. 216.1/100,000 in population >= 15 years of age). In spite of expanding DOTS services nationwide, the TB prevalence is rising, particularly in urban areas. In 2011, Population Services International, Myanmar implemented a new intensive active case finding project under TB REACH fund of Stop TB Partnership targeting slum areas of Mandalay and Yangon regions. Objective: (1) To determine if interpersonal communication and pharmacy-based strategies can increase case detection, and (2) to determine if these strategies are effective for detecting active cases of TB that would have otherwise been missed in urban slums and areas with high TB burden. Methods: Considering ethical factors a 'pre-post intervention' study design was applied. In a one-year period, 60 interpersonal communicators (IPCs) and 500 franchised registered pharmacies conducted health education, performed symptom screening, collected sputum and facilitated specimen transport to the franchised laboratories. IPCs referred sputum smear positive (SS+) diagnosed TB cases to the franchised DOTS clinics, sputum negative (SS -) cases with strong symptoms to the franchised chest X-ray (CXR) centers and confirmed cases to clinics. The pharmacies referred both SS+ and SS-cases directly to the clinics. Results: Through the IPC channel, 470,384 people received health education, 23,241 TB suspected clients were referred for sputum examination, 6,539 were referred for CXR, 1,277 SS + and 1,559 SS-TB cases were registered. In the pharmacy led channel, 1,683 suspected cases were referred for sputum examination, 240 for taking CXR, and 280 SS+ and 138 SS-were registered. Compared to the previous consecutive one-year period before the project, total registered SS+ TB cases at the regional level increased by 14% (931 to 1,063 cases) in Mandalay and 9.4% (9,473 to 10,364 cases) in Yangon through this project. Conclusion: Using IPC and pharmacies resulted in the registration of a substantial number of additional TB cases, showing that the strategy was able to reach previously unreached susceptible TB cases.","cited":22,"publisher":"CHULALONGKORN UNIV, FAC MED","year":2015,"volume":"29","issue":"4","pages":8},{"authors":"Bakibinga, Pauline; Kabaria, Caroline; Kyobutungi, Catherine; Manyara, Anthony; Mbaya, Nelson; Mohammed, Shukri; Njeri, Anne; Azam, Iqbal; Iqbal, Romaina; Mazaffar, Shahida; Rizvi, Narjis; Rizvi, Tayyaba; Rehman, Hamid Ur; Ahmed, Syed A.

In poor urban environments, such as slums, censuses can often be out-of-date or fail to record transient residents, maps may be incomplete, and access to sites can be limit, all of which prohibits obtaining an accurate sampling frame. This article describes a method to conduct a survey in slum settings in the context of the NIHR Global Health Research Unit on Improving Health in Slums project. Methods: We identify four key steps: obtaining site access, generation of a sampling frame, sampling, and field data collection. Stakeholder identification and engagement is required to negotiate access. A spatially-referenced sampling frame can be generated by: remote participatory mapping from satellite imagery; local participatory mapping and ground-truthing; and identification of all residents of each structure. We propose to use a spatially-regulated sampling method to ensure spatial coverage across the site. Finally, data collection using tablet devices and open-source software can be conducted using the generated sample and maps. Discussion: Slums are home to a growing population who face some of the highest burdens of disease yet who remain relatively understudied. Difficulties conducting surveys in these locations may explain this disparity.

These criticalities pose a further threat to urban sustainability. The first problem is revealed by the lack of quantifications about many environmental and socio-economic factors, as well as by a general lack of understanding about slums as systems. This study is aimed at overcoming the present knowledge weakness, developing a preliminary site-specific system representation of a slum as a system. In particular, a case study of a Gypsy camp in Napoli (S Italy) was chosen for such a purpose. Focusing on solid waste, an approximate evaluation of informal waste picking activity was performed. Basic parameters of generated wastewater, which is dispersed in the environment due to the absence of any sewerage infrastructure, are accounted according to environmental engineering standards. In addition, considering a second abandoned camp (Brecce Sant'Erasmo, Napoli, Italy), specific-site remediation costs were calculated. Results evidence the necessity of a better understanding of resources flows within slums. A first planning action for the studied area would be to separate the areas for waste processing with respect to living areas. Basic infrastructures for solid waste and wastewater management are also necessary to improve the life quality of slum dwellers, while reducing the existing impacts. Finally, also a study to detail atmospheric emissions characteristics would be desirable. Specific upgrading solutions are indicated on the basis of the existing literature. They include planning and monitoring actions, together with the development of engineered solutions for waste and wastewater management. (c) 2019 L&H Scientific Publishing, LLC.

A major challenge for sustainable urbanization policies and strategies is how to address the complexity of urbanization, especially the ongoing growth of informal settlements and slums in developing countries. It is acknowledged that those living their lives in such housing and settlements suffer greater levels of spatial, economic and social exclusion from the benefits of urbanization that other segments of the urban population. Using a case study approach, this paper examines the range of challenges associated with the growth of informal settlements and slums, seeking to understand how they are positioned via upgrading policies in city urbanization plans and strategies in Indonesia's third largest city, Bandung. The research finds that there has been a shift in kampung and slum upgrading policy from in-situ solutions to vertical housing towers which appear incompatible in accommodating the way of life practiced in kampung adaptive urbanism contexts. The manner in which city governments manage informal settlements and slums by seeking to reshape and restructure the lifestyles of residents to align with formal market measures has a major impact on existing disadvantaged communities. The paper concludes with a call for greater leadership, political commitment and recognition of contextual responses when developing slum upgrading policies set within urbanization policies and strategies branded as sustainable.","cited":69,"publisher":"MDPI AG","year":2017,"volume":"9","issue":"8","pages":27},{"authors":"Catao, Marconi do O.","title":"SOCIAL EXCLUSION AND SLUM IN RIO DE JANEIRO","source":"REVISTA DE DIREITO DA CIDADE-CITY LAW","language":"Portuguese","doc":"Article","abstract":"This paper discusses the social inequities present in the reality of Brazilian daily life, as the consequences resulting from globalization.

Not surprisingly, its latest global development priorities, announced through its Sustainable Development Goals agenda in 2015, emphasize addressing the slum challenge in developing countries as a major goal. Our study focuses on gaining an in-depth understanding of the nature and extent of such slum challenge faced by Nairobi. Specifically, using data from a recent (2012-13) statistically representative survey, we conduct a systematic empirical analysis of the rental housing market conditions faced by households living in slum versus formal areas of Nairobi. Our analysis findings establish relevant benchmarking for key policy relevant measures against which to evaluate the efficacy of new policy initiatives. Taken together, our findings show that the households in Nairobi's slum areas, compared to their counterparts in formal areas, are currently facing a substantial double jeopardy. On one hand, they face significant disparity gaps - about 24 percentage points in less coverage - across a myriad of housing and living condition indicators. For some basic services like water, toilet and public sewage disposal, the gaps are as high as 40-50 percentage points. On the other hand, we were able to quantify for the first time the extent of rent premium - about 16 percent - that Nairobi's slum tenants are paying relative to their formal area counterparts, after adjusting for housing quality conditions. While our study's primary goal was on demonstrating the presence and the extent of the double jeopardy, it also sheds important insights from normative policy perspectives. A novel insight here is that although formal tenure agreements are rare in Nairobi's slums, the tenants do pay a rent premium of about 18 percent if they possess such agreements.

One setting of particular importance is the informal settlements or 'slums' that are gradually dominating the urban space. We undertook a scoping review and synthesis of existing evidence on adolescent SRHR in slums in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) focusing on the characteristics and nature of existing evidence. Methods The scoping review was conducted based on Arksey and O'Malley framework and in accordance with the guidance on scoping reviews from the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) and using PRISMA reporting guidelines for scoping reviews. A comprehensive search was undertaken in PubMed, POPLINE, African Journals Online (AJOL), Bioline International and Google Scholar. The search was confined to studies published in peer reviewed journals and reports published online between January 2000 and May 2019. Studies were included in the review if they addressed SRHR issues among adolescents living in urban slums in SSA. Results The review included a total of 54 studies. The majority (79.5%) of studies were quantitative. The bulk of studies (85.2%) were observational studies with only eight intervention studies. While half (27) of the studies focused exclusively on adolescents (10-19 years), 12 studies combined adolescents with other young people (10-24 years). The studies were skewed towards sexual behavior (44%) and HIV/AIDS (43%) with very few studies focusing on other SRHR issues such as contraception, abortion, gender-based violence and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) other than HIV. Most of the studies highlighted the significantly higher risks for poor SRHR outcomes among adolescents in slums as compared to their peers in other settlements. Conclusion Young people growing up in slums face tremendous challenges in relation to their SRHR needs resulting in poor outcomes such as early and unintended pregnancy, STIs, and sexual violence. The results of this review point to several potential target areas for programming, policy, and research aimed at improved adolescent SRHR in slums in SSA.","funding":"David and Lucile Packard FoundationThe David & Lucile Packard Foundation [2016-6250]; African Regional Office of the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency, Sida [12103]","cited":63,"publisher":"BMC","year":2020,"volume":"17","issue":"1","pages":14},{"authors":"Uddin, Md Jasim; Larson, Charles P.; Oliveras, Elizabeth; Khan, A.

This intervention trial used a pre- and post-test design. An intervention package was tested from September 2006 to August 2007 in two urban slums. The intervention package included: (a) an extended EPI service schedule; (b) training for service providers on valid doses and management of side-effects; (c) a screening tool to identify immunization needs among clinic attendants; and (d) an EPI support group for social mobilization. Data were obtained from random sample surveys, service statistics and qualitative interviews. Analysis of quantitative data was based on a 'before and after' assessment of selected immunization-coverage indicators. Qualitative data were analysed using content analysis. Ninety-nine per cent of the children were fully immunized after implementation of the interventions compared with only 43% before implementation. Antigen-wise coverage after implementation was also significantly higher compared with before implementation. Only 1% drop-out was observed after implementation of the interventions while it was 33% before implementation. At baseline, a significantly higher proportion of children of non-working mothers (75%) were fully immunized compared with children of working mothers (14%). Although the proportion of fully immunized children of both non-working and working mothers was significantly higher at endline, fully immunized children of working mothers dramatically improved at endline (99%) compared with baseline (14%). The findings suggest the effectiveness of a 'package of interventions' in improving child immunization coverage in urban slums. However, further research is needed to fully assess the effectiveness of the package, to assess the individual components in order to identify those that make the biggest contribution to coverage, and to assess the sustainability of this package within the existing service delivery system, particularly on a wider scale.","funding":"Government of Bangladesh through IHP-HNPRP","cited":32,"publisher":"OXFORD UNIV PRESS","year":2010,"volume":"25","issue":"1","pages":11},{"authors":"van de Vijver, Steven; Oti, Samuel; van Charante, Eric Moll; Allender, Steven; Foster, Charlie; Lange, Joep; Oldenburg, Brian; Kyobutungi, Catherine; Agyemang, Charles","title":"Cardiovascular prevention model from Kenyan slums to migrants in the Netherlands","source":"GLOBALIZATION AND HEALTH","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the main cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. As prevention and treatment of CVD often requires active screening and lifelong follow up it is a challenge for health systems both in high-income and low and middle-income countries to deliver adequate care to those in need, with efficient use of resources. We developed a health service model for primary prevention of CVD suitable for implementation in the Nairobi slums, based on best practices from public health and the private sectors. The model consists of four key intervention elements focusing on increasing awareness, incentives for promoting access to screening and treatment, and improvement of long-term adherence to prescribed medications. More than 5,000 slum dwellers aged >= 35 years and above have been screened in the study resulting in more than 1000 diagnosed with hypertension and referred to the clinic. Some marginalized groups in high-income countries like African migrants in the Netherlands also have low rates of awareness, treatment and control of hypertension as the slum population in Nairobi. The parallel between both groups is that they have a combination of risky lifestyle, are prone to chronic diseases such as hypertension, have limited knowledge about hypertension and its complications, and a tendency to stay away from clinics partly due to cultural beliefs in alternative forms of treatment, and lack of trust in health providers. Based on these similarities it was suggested by several policymakers that the model from Nairobi can be applied to other vulnerable populations such as African migrants in high-income countries. The model can be contextualized to the local situation by adapting the key steps of the model to the local settings. The involvement and support of African communities' infrastructures and health care staff is crucial, and the most important enabler for successful implementation of the model in migrant communities in high-income countries. Once these stakeholders have expressed their interest, the impact of the adapted intervention can be measured through an implementation research approach including collection of costs from health care providers' perspective and health effects in the target population, similar to the study design for Nairobi.","funding":"William and Flora Hewlett Foundation; Swedish International Development Agency (SIDA)","cited":19,"publisher":"BMC","year":2015,"volume":"11","pages":6},{"authors":"Burgold, Julia; Rolfes, Manfred","title":"Of voyeuristic safari tours and responsible tourism with educational value: Observing moral communication in slum and township tourism in Cape Town and Mumbai","source":"ERDE","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"Sightseeing in the poorest quarters of southern hemisphere cities has been observed occurring in Cape Town, Rio de Janeiro, Mumbai and many other cities.

I use qualitative data derived from ethnographic fieldwork in four urban slum communities in Delhi, India, to examine the strategies they employ for countering everyday problems of access to water and toilets. While literature explains communities' use of informal arrangements and political engagement to access water, what is less clear is why similar strategies do not emerge in the case of toilets. While collective action literature focuses on community-level factors such as social capital, trust, ethnic heterogeneity, and intermediary organizations, it often ignores how services interact with the slum ecology and the institutional frameworks they are embedded within. Caste, gender, religion, class, and influential slum leaders no doubt mediate everyday social relations in Indian slums, but communities that surmount these obstacles may still not be able to mobilize in a way that improves everyday service delivery. I argue that communities are able to coordinate when they think their efforts will yield success -both locally in terms of inducing reciprocity and reducing free riding as well as when they get appropriate institutional support for their initiatives. Infrastructural characteristics unique to a service determine whether reciprocity and cooperation can be sustained within the built environment of the slum. Bureaucratic complexity determines whether communities will be able to negotiate successfully. In the case of water, easy adaptability within the neighborhood and ease of bureaucratic access allow for sustained coordination within communities. The infrastructural nature of toilets makes it harder to find arrangements that will work within the slum ecology and induce cooperation. The complicated institutional dynamics create obstacles on top of that deter sustained mobilization. What communities experience instead is a sporadic pattern of collective action around poorly functioning public toilets. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Rising food and fuel prices in recent years have put the food security of the urban poor in a precarious position. In cities worldwide, urban agriculture helps some poor people gain access to food, but urban agriculture is less common in densely populated slums that lack space. In the Kibera slums of Nairobi, Kenya, households have recently begun a new form of urban agriculture called sack gardening in which vegetables such as kale and Swiss chard are planted into large sacks filled with topsoil. This paper examines relationships among sack gardening, social capital, and food security in Kibera. We used a mixed methods approach, combining qualitative interviews with a household survey, as well as focus group discussions with both farmers and non-farmers. We present evidence that sack gardening increases social capital, especially for those households that undertake sack gardening in groups. We also find that sack gardening in the Kibera slums has a positive impact on household food security by improving household dietary diversity and by reducing the need to resort to painful coping mechanisms that are used during food shortages.","funding":"NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [BCS-1030325]; Society of Women Geographers Pruitt Dissertation Research Fellowship; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF)","cited":55,"publisher":"SPRINGER","year":2013,"volume":"30","issue":"3","pages":16},{"authors":"Sunikka-Blank, Minna; Bardhan, Ronita; Haque, Anika Nasra","title":"Gender, domestic energy and design of inclusive low-income habitats: A case of slum rehabilitation housing in Mumbai, India","source":"ENERGY RESEARCH & SOCIAL SCIENCE","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"Women's involvement in decision-making in domestic energy remains an under-researched area, especially in the urban context. This research adopts a gendered perspective in exploring slum rehabilitation housing in India. Based on a household survey and a focus group discussion (FGD), women's household and working practices are explored in interview narratives and systems analysis. The findings show that the relocation to slum rehabilitation housing (SRH) has radically changed women's household routines (cooking, comfort, childrearing, working and entertainment practices) and that women are more affected by the relocation than men. Changed practices, poor design of SRH and lack of outdoor space have radically increased electricity use and living costs in all the surveyed households. The economic pressure forces women into lowly paid jobs or informal economy, creating a vicious circle where women's time poverty further reduces their social capital and opportunities for self-development in terms of education or formal employment. A comparison of SRH typologies shows that building design has great influence both on gendered use of space and electricity use, advocating a courtyard typology. Further, interviews with policy-makers reveal a dis-juncture between the occupant realities and the policy objectives.

It attracts the rural folk from neighbouring districts and the city is undergoing rapid changes in terms of population growth as well as in the degree of urbanization due to which the slum population is increasing. There are 60 slums that account for 11% of city's population. This study aims to contribute some sustainable methodologies for better execution of slum development programs to advance the living conditions of slum dwellers. Slum ontology has been built to identify slums from very high-resolution satellite data that will benefit all stakeholders. The developed ontology was validated with field survey and the help of field photographs, the physical and socio-economic conditions were documented. As per the slum ontology, basic inputs for the Cellular Automata (CA) model were identified and criteria maps with scores were generated. The suitability map was created by giving appropriate weight to the factors. When the slum map prepared based on slum ontology was overlaid on the final results, the CA model output has given reliable results regarding current slum distribution and also a hint of the possible occurrence of slums in the future. Since the proposed land use plan for 2021 has been finalized by the Urban Local Body (ULB), the suitable area for developing affordable housing stock was suggested for preventing slums from arising. The Spatial Decision Support System (SDSS) was built for selecting slum development options. The design and running of the SDSS model were demonstrated with one case study - Borabai nagar slum to enable the ULB to apply the approach to other slum areas for effective implementation of slum development programs.","funding":"HSMI/HUDCO","cited":55,"publisher":"ELSEVIER","year":2020,"volume":"9","issue":"1","pages":19},{"authors":"Chakravarthy, Vasudha; Rajagopal, Shobhita; Joshi, Bhavya","title":"Does Menstrual Hygiene Management in Urban Slums Need a Different Lens?

Increasing urbanbiased economic activity and job creation are leading to rapid urbanisation, and a greater number of poor people today are living in cities and towns in India. Slums, often the residence of migrants and urban poor, are underserved areas with poor housing, insufficient living space, basic infrastructure and services such as clean drinking water, drainage and electricity, and poor access to toilets and sanitation services. Urban poverty and life in slums significantly compromise the ability of women and girls to effectively manage menstruation. There are many factors that affect how women manage their monthly period, such as the lack of information and awareness on menstruation, unaffordability of menstrual products, poor access to water, sanitation and hygiene infrastructure and services, lack of privacy, safety and security.

The prevalence of smoking is high among the general male population in Bangladesh. Unfortunately smoking information including correlates of smoking in the cities especially in the urban slums is very scarce, although urbanization is rapid in Bangladesh and slums are growing quickly in its major cities. Therefore this study reported prevalences of cigarette and bidi smoking and their correlates separately by urban slums and non-slums in Bangladesh. Methods: We used secondary data which was collected by the 2006 Urban Health Survey. The data were representative for the urban areas in Bangladesh. Both slums and non-slums located in the six City Corporations were considered. Slums in the cities were identified by two steps, first by using the satellite images and secondly by ground truthing. At the next stage, several clusters of households were selected by using proportional sampling. Then from each of the selected clusters, about 25 households were randomly selected. Information of a total of 12,155 adult men, aged 15 59 years, was analyzed by stratifying them into slum (= 6,488) and non-slum (= 5,667) groups. Simple frequency, bivariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed using SPSS. Results: Overall smoking prevalence for the total sample was 53.6% with significantly higher prevalences among men in slums (59.8%) than non-slums (46.4%). Respondents living in slums reported a significantly (P < 0.001) higher prevalence of smoking cigarettes (53.3%) as compared to those living in non-slums (44.6%). A similar pattern was found for bidis (slums = 11.4% and non-slums = 3.2%, P < 0.001). Multivariable logistic regression revealed significantly higher odds ratio (OR) of smoking cigarettes (OR = 1.12, 95% CI = 1.03-1.22), bidis (OR = 1.90, 95% CI = 1.58-2.29) and any of the two (OR = 1.23, 95% CI = 1.13-1.34) among men living in slums as compared to those living in non-slums when controlled for age, division, education, marital status, religion, birth place and types of work. Division, education and types of work were the common significant correlates for both cigarette and bidi smoking in slums and non-slums by multivariable logistic regressions. Other significant correlates of smoking cigarettes were marital status (both areas), birth place (slums), and religion (non-slums). Similarly significant factors for smoking bidis were age (both areas), marital status (slums), religion (non-slums), and birth place (both areas). Conclusion: The men living in the urban slums reported higher rates of smoking cigarettes and bidis as compared to men living in the urban non-slums. Some of the significant correlates of smoking e. g. education and division should be considered for prevention activities. Our findings clearly underscore the necessity of interventions and preventions by policy makers, public health experts and other stakeholders in slums because smoking was more prevalent in the slum communities with detrimental health sequelae.","funding":"National Institute of Population Research and Training (NIPORT)","cited":44,"publisher":"BMC","year":2009,"volume":"9","pages":12},{"authors":"Swapan, M.

Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) have the potential to improve continuity of care for slum residents, but their implementation is complicated by technical and non-technical limitations. This study sought practical insights about facilitators and barriers to EMR implementation in urban slum environments. Method: Descriptive qualitative method was used to explore staff perceptions about a recent open-source EMR deployment in two primary care clinics in Kibera, Nairobi. Participants were interviewed using open-ended, semi-structured questions. Content analysis was used when exploring transcribed data. Results: Three major themes - systems, software, and social considerations - emerged from content analysis, with sustainability concerns prevailing. Although participants reported many systems (e.g., power, network, Internet, hardware, interoperability) and software (e.g., data integrity, confidentiality, function) challenges, social factors (e.g., identity management, training, use incentives) appeared the most important impediments to sustainability. Discussion: These findings are consistent with what others have reported, especially the importance of practical barriers to EMR deployments in resource-constrained settings. Other findings contribute unique insights about social determinants of EMR impact in slum settings, including the challenge of multiple-identity management and development of meaningful incentives to staff compliance. Conclusions: This study exposes front-line experiences with opportunities and shortcomings of EMR implementations in urban slum primary care clinics. Although the promise is great, there are a number of unique system, software and social challenges that EMR advocates should address before expecting sustainable EMR use in resource-constrained settings.

However, threat of eviction did not completely disappear from the minds of bustee dwellers. The objectives of this paper are to explore the perceived level of fear of eviction possessed by residents of bustees in Dhaka and to identify the bases of such fear. Data collected through a questionnaire survey suggest that the overwhelming majority of respondents fear eviction and do not want to return to their villages. The survey data reveal that past eviction and previous bustee experience, length of stay in Dhaka, and having close friends/relatives who live in Dhaka are important determinants of respondent fear of eviction.

Qualitative data (participant observation and semi-structured interviews) and quantitative data (household questionnaire and anthropometric measurements) collected in slums in Dhaka (n = 18 mothers, n = 5 community health workers, and n = 55 children) were analysed. The subjects of the interviews were mothers and Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee (BRAC) community health workers living and working in the slums. Research findings showed that breastfeeding and complementary feeding practices for IYC were poor and inappropriate due to lack of knowledge, time, and resources in normal times and worse during flooding. One coping strategy developed by mothers purposely to protect their IYC's nutritional status was to decrease their personal food intake. Our research findings suggest that mothers perceived the negative impact of flooding on their IYC's nutritional health but did not have the means to prevent it. They could only maintain their health through coping strategies which had other negative consequences.

Potential White readers encounter various Black characters as caricatures in the text-for example, the conspiratorial nationalist, the radical preacher-which reinforce their comprehensive generalizations of Blacks (i.e., stereotypes), the primary means by which they comprehend them and also how they understand themselves as White. It argues that the narrative simultaneously interrogates race as a concept and reproduces for potential White readers the dualistic conceptualizations of race that drive racialist thinking and racist behavior.","cited":26,"publisher":"SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC","year":2010,"volume":"40","issue":"3","pages":18},{"authors":"Muralidharan, Arundati","title":"Constrained Choices? Menstrual Health and Hygiene Needs Among Adolescents in Mumbai Slums","source":"INDIAN JOURNAL OF GENDER STUDIES","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"Menstruation, an essential and healthy biological function, is cloaked in a culture of silence. Sociocultural norms at the family and community level play a pivotal role in shaping how young unmarried women understand and manage their monthly period. Less is known about how unmarried young women living in low-income urban areas in India seek help for their menstrual needs. This qualitative study seeks to understand how young unmarried women (aged 15-24) living in a slum settlement understand menstruation and perceive menstrual problems, and identifies factors that influence their help-seeking behaviour for menstrual needs and problems. It also proposes recommendations for national health programmes addressing menstrual health and hygiene. The findings echo previous research findings emphasising young unmarried women's low levels of awareness and misconceptions about menstruation. These girls perceived menstrual problems as a key concern, as it significantly interfered with their daily routine and caused emotional distress. Young women's ability and willingness to seek help to address menstrual needs is influenced by a culture of silence that surrounds menstruation, excessive scrutiny and blaming by the community, and restrictions on their mobility and interactions with peers. The findings underscore the role of mothers as gatekeepers who greatly influence young women's perceptions of menstruation and menstrual problems and their ability to seek help. Existing interventions need to be expanded to address young women's need for emotional and social support, and to involve significant gatekeepers such as mothers in promoting the health and well-being of young unmarried women in slum communities. Intervention strategies should be expanded to enhance the capacity of mothers to recognise, understand and address their teenage daughters' needs for information, emotional support and access to essential clinical and social services.","cited":47,"publisher":"SAGE PUBLICATIONS INDIA  PVT LTD","year":2019,"volume":"26","issue":"1-2","pages":28},{"authors":"Croese, Sylvia; Cirolia, Liza Rose; Graham, Nick","title":"Towards Habitat III: Confronting the disjuncture between global policy and local practice on Africa's 'challenge of slums'","source":"HABITAT INTERNATIONAL","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"The 'challenge of slums' is a global challenge, but particularly acute in Sub-Saharan Africa where in 2001 71.9% of the urban population lived in slums.

Appropriate interventions must be based on a well-grounded understanding of health determinants. Social factors are as important as physical factors in determining health status and suggest alternative interventions. Employment, stress, social exclusion, social support, substance use, nutrition, transport, and conditions during childhood are among the most important social determinants of health status identified by the International Center for Health and Society. This paper uses social determinants of health approach to understand morbidity outcomes for people residing in the slums of Surat City, India. To quantify suboptimal health behavior and identify the determinants of health status for this population survey data on household characteristics, health-seeking behavior, socioeconomic status, food and personal habits, social life, and physical activity has been used. After controlling for socioeconomic and demographic factors, logistic regression analysis reveals that social exclusion, stress, and lack of social support are significantly associated with morbidity. Thus, understanding of social determinants of health by policy makers is important as the health sector has a crucial role in addressing disparities in social determinants.","cited":34,"publisher":"SPRINGER","year":2008,"volume":"85","issue":"4","pages":12},{"authors":"Grant, Richard","title":"Planet of Slums","source":"ANNALS OF THE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN GEOGRAPHERS","language":"English","doc":"Book Review","cited":1,"publisher":"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","year":2009,"volume":"99","issue":"1","pages":4},{"authors":"JAVED, R.

The present study aimed at assessing the population prevalence of goiter and iodine deficiency in school children of 6-12 yr living in urban slums of Bhubaneswer, the capital city of Orissa. Methods. A cross-sectional study was performed using the 30-cluster sampling methodology and surveillance methods for iodine deficiency as recommended by WHO/ICCIDD/UNICEF. The total goitre rate (n=1248), urinary iodine concentration (UIC) (n=411) and iodine content of edible salt (n=368) were measured. Resutls. The goitre prevalence was 23.6% (grade 1=18.9%, grade 2=4.7%) with no significant gender variation. Goitre prevalence was significantly higher in children of 10-12 yr (P=0.012) and scheduled caste and tribe (P=0.003). Median urinary iodine concentration was 50.0 mu g/l with 85.7% of children having values less than 100 mu g/l, indicating as biochemical iodine deficiency. Median UIC was inversely in association with gradations of goitre. Children of 10-12 yr and scheduled caste/tribe communities had significantly higher median UIC (P=0.001) than their counterpart peers. About 51% of children were consuming salt having stipulated iodine content of 15 ppm. Conclusion. The study indicates moderate iodine deficiency in the population, despite a mandatory salt iodization programme in Orissa that has been in force since 1989. There is a need to improve the situation through enforcing monitoring of salt iodization to ensure quality and increasing the level of awareness about the iodized salt for sustainable prevention and control of iodine deficiency.","cited":20,"publisher":"SPRINGER INDIA","year":2007,"volume":"74","issue":"10","pages":5},{"authors":"Da Motta, Enio Laprovitera","title":"Architects and Slums in Recife (Brazil): a forgotten agenda?","source":"World Heritage and Degradation: Smart Design, Planning and Technologies","language":"English","doc":"Proceedings Paper","abstract":"Taking into account that the city of Recife in the begining of the last century was called the city of mocambos (small communities of runaway slaves); that the local politics, favored this agenda since the 1930s; that this topic was important for local artistic production and that architects, before the inauguration of an independent architecture school, in 1959, studied along with these artists (painters, sculptors) at the School of Fine Arts in Recife; one could assume that the issue of slums was present in their agenda since the first debates and that - given the current relevance of this social problem in the city - it would never be forgotten by local architects. However, as we will see, reality is not quite like that and the issue of slums not only appears late among architects as it seems to lose importance - or even be disregarded - nowadays. The paradox goes on, since this agenda is consolidated among architects in the seventies as a result of the demands for public policies related to it whereas it was totally absent of the university classroom. Inversely, this theme is currently studied at the universities, but it has disappeared as a professional possibility, losing the strength and core value it once had for public policies.

Yet the dynamics of the environmentally transmitted Leptospira pathogen has not been well characterized in these settings. We used a stratified dense sampling scheme to study the dynamics of Leptospira abundance in surface waters from a Brazilian urban slum community. We collected surface water samples during the dry, intermediate and rainy seasons within a seven-month period and quantified pathogenic Leptospira by quantitative PCR (qPCR). We used logistic and linear mixed models to identify factors that explained variation for the presence and concentration of Leptospira DNA. Among 335 sewage and 250 standing water samples, Leptospira DNA were detected in 36% and 34%, respectively. Among the 236 samples with positive results geometric mean Leptospira concentrations were 152 GEq/ mL The probability of finding Leptospira DNA was higher in sewage samples collected during the rainy season when increased leptospirosis incidence occurred, than during the dry season (47.2% vs 12.5%, respectively, p = 0.0002). There was a marked spatial and temporal heterogeneity in Leptospira DNA distribution, for which type of water, elevation, and time of day that samples were collected, in addition to season, were significant predictors. Together, these findings indicate that Leptospira are ubiquitous in the slum environment and that the water-related risk to which inhabitants are exposed is low. Seasonal increases in Leptospira presence may explain the timing of leptospirosis outbreaks. Effective prevention wilt need to consider the spatial and temporal dynamics of pathogenic Leptospira in surface waters to reduce the burden of the disease. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

About 40.9% of the unmet need was for spacing methods and 14.4% for limiting methods. Important reasons cited for unmet need for family planning services were negligent attitude of the women towards family planning, opposition by husband or others, embarrassment / hesitation / shyness for contraceptive use, poor knowledge of the FP method or availability of family planning services. Among method related reasons health concerns and fear of side effects were frequently cited reasons.

Result: Mean age of adolescent girls in the present study was 15.44 +/- 2.2years (Range: 12 to 19 years) and a majority of them were in High School 60 (60.2%). About half (42%) of the study subjects were living in Semi pucca house and only 38% had access to an independent toilet facility, 9% were practicing open defecation and remaining (51%) were using public toilets. Conclusion: The availability of sanitation facility and latrine utilization rate of the households were satisfactory. Privacy is a concern in public toilet, uses of sanitary pad was also less and changing of absorbent material in toilets was also a matter of concern for the girls.","cited":15,"publisher":"WOLTERS KLUWER MEDKNOW PUBLICATIONS","year":2019,"volume":"8","issue":"4","pages":5},{"authors":"Cruz-Oliver, D.

Slums are becoming an inevitable and growing phenomenon in cities of the global south, whose locations are inappropriate in official statistics and maps. Thus the automatic detection and identification of slums provides vibrant information to decision-makers for formulating pro-poor policies in urban planning. However, field surveys are used as the conventional methods for slum detection, which are expensive and inefficient. The challenge is to find an automatic approach for identifying slums from VHR imagery. Although numerous studies focused on detecting slums from satellite data, only limited number captured their differences. Due to the unique spectral signatures of urban slums, it could not be simply classified as other urban (buildings, vegetation, and roads) features. We explore the potential of the dilated kernel-based deep convolutional neural network (DK-DCNN) approach to the learning of discriminatory spatial features and the automatic detection of slums from other features. However, the result obtained by the proposed DK-DCNN achieves high accuracy. The open area of informal settlements and the roofing structures of formal settlements are misclassified as slums. Morphological spatial pattern analysis, based on mathematical morphology, is used as a postprocessing method to enhance the classification accuracy. The four distinct very high-resolution satellite images captured byWorldView-2 Sensor (1.84 m) of Madurai and Tiruppur city, South India, have shown the performance of the proposed method to distinguish urban slums from other features by producing higher accuracy than any other approach.

This article proposes a machine learning, hierarchical object-based method to map slum settlements using very high-resolution (VHR) imagery and land boundary data to support slum upgrading. The proposed method is tested in Kingston Metropolitan Area, Jamaica. First, the VHR imagery is classified into major land cover classes (i.e., the initial land cover map). Second, the VHR imagery and land boundary layer are used to obtain homogenous neighborhoods (HNs). Third, the initial land cover map is used to derive multiple context, spectral, and texture image features according to the local physical characteristics of slum settlements. Fourth, a machine-learning classifier, classification and regression trees, is used to classify HNs into slum and nonslum settlements using only the effective image features. Finally, reference data collected manually are used to assess the accuracy of the classification. In the training site, an overall accuracy of 0.935 is achieved. The effective image indicators for slum mapping include the building layout, building density, building roof characteristics, and distance from buildings to gullies. The classifier and those features selected from the training site are further used to map slums in two validating sites to assess the transferability of our approach. Overall accuracy of the two validating sites reached 0.928 and 0.929, respectively, suggesting that the features and classification model obtained from one site has the potential to be transferred to other areas in Jamaica and possibly other developing Caribbean countries with similar situation and data availability.","funding":"National Nature Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31700999]; Hong Kong Polytechnic UniversityHong Kong Polytechnic University [1-ZE6Q]","cited":52,"publisher":"IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","year":2020,"volume":"13","pages":12},{"authors":"Thorn, Jessica; Thornton, Thomas F.; Helfgott, Ariella","title":"Autonomous adaptation to global environmental change in peri-urban settlements: Evidence of a growing culture of innovation and revitalisation in Mathare Valley Slums, Nairobi","source":"GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"The growth of pen-urban areas is increasingly recognised as a dominant planning and urban design challenge for the 21st century. In burgeoning poor urban settlements growing on city margins, autonomous adaptation strategies are often the only measures to respond to increasing climatic and compounding stressors. Yet, in both research and practice there remains lack of understanding regarding the dynamics of adaptation and risk reduction at the level of the community. In this paper, we argue urban slums are ideal places to consider adaptation because they offer examples of more extreme social-ecological stress than one finds in more established communities - the kind we can anticipate more broadly in the face of climate change. A framework for identifying local adaptation processes is presented and applied to analyse the case of Mathare Valley Slums in Nairobi, Kenya - a densely populated suburb, where residents are regularly exposed to flooding from heavy rainfall. Findings reveal that slums, often viewed as illegitimate, makeshift, and temporary settlements, are places experienced by many residents as permanent communities characterised by rapid environmental change. Processes of adaptation in Mathare have become institutionalised through time, as anew generation of people imagine themselves staying and (re)organise to achieve a higher level of functioning through various strategies to reduce risk. Innovative and revitalising adaptation occurs as residents shift from employing more generic and expected coping strategies, such as evacuating homes or economic diversification, to creating gated communities and savings schemes to maintain and improve the settlement, despite uncertain tenure. Both formal and informal institutions, such as youth groups, play an important role in governing such heterogeneous localities, incrementally upgrading the slum and providing critical public services. Long-term residents' increasing recognition of the permanence of the slum community and its stressful conditions appears to lead to more collective action toward adaptation pathways. However, this is in marked contrast to the dominant non-local perspective of Mathare's status as both impermanent and illegal, which prevails among government officials. As such, strategies are generally not incorporated into planned interventions. While progressive policies designed to reduce risk exist, they remain nascent in their establishment and fail to benefit slumdwellers. The case illustrates the need to incorporate the wealth of knowledge, techniques, and experience extant at the community level in the development of adaptation planning. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The majority of these people have settled in slum areas, which often have poor sanitation and housing conditions. Therefore, this study was conducted to gather evidence on nutritional status and associated factors among children aged 6-59 months living in slum areas of Gondar city, northwest Ethiopia. Methods: A community-based cross-sectional study was carried out from 3 to 28 May 2017. A total of 593 children from the slum areas aged 6.-69 months were included in the study. Bivariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were carried out to identify the independent determinants of stunting and wasting. Results: The overall prevalences of stunting and wasting were 42.3% (95% CI 38.34, 46.3%) and 7.3% (95% CI 5.3, 9.4%), respectively. Poor wealth status (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] =1.79; 95% CI 1.19, 2.70) and age of child 24-35 months (AOR=2.56; 95% CI 1.32, 4.96), 36-47 months (AOR=2.27; 95% CI 1.14, 4.54) and 48-59 months (AOR=2.69; 95% CI 1.35, 5.32) were independently associated with stunting.

PTSD is a mental health condition that develops among some individuals who experience or witness a traumatic event. Several other factors could place individuals at heightened risk of PTSD including stress and comorbid mental disorders. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the prevalence and factors associated with PTSD among female urban slum dwellers in Ibadan, Nigeria. Methods We conducted a cross sectional survey using multistage sampling of 550 women aged 18 and above from selected slums. Interviewer administered questionnaires were used to elicit information on experience of childhood trauma, recent stressors, intimate partner violence, other mental disorders, sociodemographic characteristics and PTSD. PTSD was measured using the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire (HTQ) which is based on DSM IV. A multivariable linear regression model was built to test associations between PTSD and independent variables. Results The prevalence for PTSD was found to be 4.18% and the mean PTSD score was 5.80 +/- 7.11. Sexual abuse in childhood, past year intimate partner violence and anxiety were significantly associated with higher PTSD scores. PTSD was not significantly associated with a history of recent stressors. Education, employment and marital status were not associated with PTSD however, age and wealth index showed marginal association with PTSD.

Kuritsyn), published in Tomsk at the beginning of the 20th century. The book was one of the elements of the Tomsk city folklore of the Soviet times, it passed from hand to hand, was stored in families as one of the attributes of a lost pre-revolutionary life. At the same time readers of The Tomsk Slums never overestimated the artistic significance of the book. By the content it is a classic adventure novel, pulp fiction about the adventures of a group of swindlers in the pre-revolutionary Tomsk and other Siberian cities (Barnaul, Novonikolayevsk). This kind of literature was widespread in Russia in the early 20th century, mainly in the European part. The Tomsk Slums was published in the Tomsk newspaper Sibirskie otgoloski [Siberian echoes] in 1908, the book edition of 1500 copies was published the same year, and then reissued in 1909. In 1908-1910 Sibirskie otgoloski published novels The Man in the Mask and then The Pursuit of Millions (publication not finished), which are a continuation of Tomsk Slums. After the establishment of the Soviet power, the novel fell out of the scope of the official publishing and literary criticism for 80 years. But it continued to exist at the level of folklore and samizdat, was distributed in the form of photocopies and typewritten reprints. In 1990, Krasnoe znamya, a Tomsk publishing company, reissued the novel in 50 thousand copies. The modern reader can get acquainted with the text of the novel on the site of the largest Russian electronic library Lib. ru, find it in the databases of various electronic bookstores. The new reissue, which is intended by the authors of the article, includes several conceptual aspects. First of all, the reconstruction of the full text of the novel, with the restoration of omissions and verification with the newspaper edition. It is necessary to correct the errors, add the missing chapters, etc. It seems logical to combine all the parts of the novel in one piece, as it appeared at the time of the first publication on the pages of Sibirskie otgoloski, with the preservation of the common name The Tomsk Slums. The alleged republishing requires an extensive scientific commentary and an introductory article, which would present the realities of the pre-revolutionary Tomsk of the early 20th century, the specificity of Sibirskie otgoloski, explain the terms and jargon in the novel, trace the connection of The Tomsk Slums by Non-Krestovsky with Peters-burg Slums by Krestovsky. In the new edition special attention will be paid to illustrating the text, and it can be done on the basis of the existing pre-revolutionary images of Tomsk. The digital version also gives an opportunity to make an interactive map of the characters' movements around Tomsk, Barnaul, Novosibirsk, both pre-revolutionary and modern, as well as to create an adventure game based on The Tomsk Slums.","cited":7,"publisher":"TOMSK STATE UNIV","year":2017,"volume":"14","pages":12},{"authors":"Bair, Robert A.; Ozcan, Onur O.; Calabria, Jorge L.; Dick, George H.; Yeh, Daniel H.","title":"Feasibility of anaerobic membrane bioreactors (AnMBR) for onsite sanitation and resource recovery (nutrients, energy and water) in urban slums","source":"WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"Slums are challenging locations for sanitation technologies. High population densities, a lack of water and electricity infrastructure, and space constraints combine to ensure that many traditional waste treatment technologies fail when implemented in this context. This paper proposes the use of anaerobic membrane bioreactors (AnMBRs) for slum sanitation. AnMBRs allow for localized water reuse, high quality treatment, and energy production at the point of treatment. A water, energy, nutrient, and mass balance was conducted on a theoretical AnMBR directly coupled to a public toilet. The combined system would be capable of recycling its water for use in toilet flushing and would be capable of providing enough energy to power both the toilet and AnMBR operation. The addition of food waste to the feed would help to ensure process stability and energy production by the AnMBR. Ammonia accumulation within the system would have to be managed through struvite precipitation, ion exchange, oxidation, plant uptake or other means. Generated biogas can be converted into heat and/or electricity using small scale gas generators. AnMBR technology has high potential for success in slum settings, if considerations for maintenance and supplies are made as part of the design and system delivery.","funding":"Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Grand Challenges Explorations Grant [OPP1044659]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1243510]; Pentair X-Flow; Office Of Internatl Science &EngineeringNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD) [1243510] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","cited":16,"publisher":"IWA PUBLISHING","year":2015,"volume":"72","issue":"9","pages":9},{"authors":"Doshi, Sapana","title":"The Politics of the Evicted: Redevelopment, Subjectivity, and Difference in Mumbai's Slum Frontier","source":"ANTIPODE","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"In recent years cities around the world have undergone mass slum clearances for redevelopment.

Whereas, child health indicators are generally better in urban than rural areas, some population groups in urban areas, such as children residing in urban slums do not enjoy this urban health advantage. In the context of increasing urbanisation and urban poverty manifesting with proliferation of urban slums, the health of under-five children in slum areas remains a public health imperative in Malawi. This paper explores healthcare-seeking practices for common childhood illnesses focusing on use of biomedical health services and perceived barriers to accessing under-five child health services in urban slums of Lilongwe, Malawi's capital city. Methods: Qualitative data from 8 focus group discussions with caregivers and 11 in-depth interviews with key informants conducted from September 2012 to April 2013 were analysed using conventional content analysis. Results: Whereas, caregivers sought care from biomedical health providers, late care-seeking also emerged as a major theme and phenomenon. Home management was actively undertaken for childhood illnesses. Various health system barriers: lack of medicines and supplies; long waiting times; late facility opening times; negative attitude of health workers; suboptimal examination of the sick child; long distance to health facility; and cost of healthcare were cited in this qualitative inquiry as critical health system factors affecting healthcare-seeking for child health services.

Data were generated using self-developed and validated questionnaire. Generated data were analyzed using descriptive analysis. Results: The result of the study showed low utilization of contraceptives at 38.7%. Leading barriers for nonutilization are fear of side effects (65.2%), followed by desire for girl/boy child (31.3%), husbands' disapproval (25.8%), followed by 17.7% no family support (in-laws), lack of knowledge about contraceptive methods (25.3%), and lack of personal interest to use contraceptives (23.2%). The most frequently used method was tubectomy (73.6%). Copper T (14.4%) and male condom (8.0%) were predominant method among the temporary family planning methods used by the study population.

Education, encouragement of health education programs and involvement of the spouse and inlaws might promote contraceptive utilization in slum dwellers.","cited":21,"publisher":"ELSEVIER - DIVISION REED ELSEVIER INDIA PVT LTD","year":2020,"volume":"8","issue":"4","pages":5},{"authors":"Mohamed, Shukri F.; Haregu, Tilahun Nigatu; Uthman, Olalekan A.; Khayeka-Wandabwa, Christopher; Muthuri, Stella Kagwiria; Asiki, Gershim; Kyobutungi, Catherine; Gill, Paramjit","title":"Multimorbidity from Chronic Conditions among Adults in Urban Slums: The AWI-Gen Nairobi Site Study Findings","source":"GLOBAL HEART","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"Background: In the era of double burden of infectious and non-communicable diseases in sub-Saharan Africa, the burden of multimorbidity is likely to be common. However, there is limited evidence on the burden and its associated factors in the sub-Saharan African context. Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the levels and identify determinants of multimorbidity from chronic conditions in two urban slums in Nairobi. Methods: Data collected from 2003 study participants aged 40-60 years in two urban slums of the Nairobi Urban Health and Demographic Surveillance System in 2015 were used. Using self-report, anthropometry and key biomarkers, data on 16 conditions including chronic diseases, behavioral disorders and metabolic abnormalities were gathered. Lifetime multimorbidity defined by the occurrence of at least two chronic conditions in an individual at any time during their life course was computed. Factors associated with lifetime multimorbidity were identified using multiple logistic regression. Findings: A total of 2,081 chronic conditions were identified among 1,302 individuals. While 701 (35.0%) had no chronic condition, single morbidity was reported in 726 (36.2%) of the study population. The overall prevalence of lifetime multimorbidity was 28.7%. The prevalence of dyads and triads of simultaneous occurrences of conditions (episodic multimorbidity) was 20.8% and 6.1%, respectively. Single morbidity was positively associated with gender and alcohol consumption; and negatively associated with employment. Women, older people, the unemployed, current smokers and current alcohol consumers had higher levels of lifetime multimorbidity in the study population. Interpretation: The findings of this study indicate that a considerable proportion of adults living in urban slums experience multimorbidity from chronic conditions. Further studies with a better rigor to establish temporal associations between socio-demographic factors and the occurrence of chronic conditions are needed to explore the impacts and implications on health status and health system.","funding":"National Institute of Health Research using Official Development Assistance (ODA); National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI)United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI); Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD); Office of the Director (OD) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) of the USA as part of the H3Africa ConsortiumUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [U54HG006938]","cited":37,"publisher":"UBIQUITY PRESS LTD","year":2021,"volume":"16","issue":"1","pages":13},{"authors":"Zakia, Umme; Antara, Amena Taher; Islam, Md Saiful; Ferdouas, Md.

The two communities are under continuous demographic surveillance. A monthly calendar type questionnaire was administered retrospectively to cover the period since birth to the interview date and data on sexual behavior, menstrual resumption, breastfeeding patterns, and contraception were collected. The results show that sexual resumption occurs earlier than menses and postpartum contraceptive use. Out of all postpartum months where women were exposed to the risk of another pregnancy, about 28% were months where no contraceptive method was used. Menstrual resumption acts as a trigger for initiating contraceptive use with a peak of contraceptive initiation occurring shortly after the first month when menses are reported. There was no variation in contraceptive method choice between women who initiate use before and after menstrual resumption. Overall, poor postpartum women in marginalized areas such as slums experience an appreciable risk of unintended pregnancy.

In India, early neonatal deaths make up four-fifths of neonatal deaths and infant mortality three-quarters of under-five mortality. Information is scarce on cause-specific perinatal and neonatal mortality in urban settings in low-income countries. We conducted verbal autopsies for stillbirths and neonatal deaths in Mumbai slum settlements. Our objectives were to classify deaths according to international cause-specific criteria and to identify major causes of delay in seeking and receiving health care for maternal and newborn health problems. Methods: Over two years, 2005-2007, births and newborn deaths in 48 slum areas were identified prospectively by local informants. Verbal autopsies were collected by trained field researchers, cause of death was classified by clinicians, and family narratives were analysed to investigate delays on the pathway to mortality. Results: Of 105 stillbirths, 65 were fresh (62%) and obstetric complications dominated the cause classification. Of 116 neonatal deaths, 87 were early and the major causes were intrapartum-related (28%), prematurity (23%), and severe infection (22%). Bereavement was associated with socioeconomic quintile, previous stillbirth, and number of antenatal care visits. We identified 201 individual delays in 121/187 birth narratives (65%). Overall, delays in receiving care after arrival at a health facility dominated and were mostly the result of referral from one institution to another. Most delays in seeking care were attributed to a failure to recognise symptoms of complications or their severity. Conclusions: In Mumbai's slum settlements, early neonatal deaths made up 75% of neonatal deaths and intrapartum-related complications were the greatest cause of mortality. Delays were identified in two-thirds of narratives, were predominantly related to the provision of care, and were often attributable to referrals between health providers. There is a need for clear protocols for care and transfer at each level of the health system, and an emphasis on rapid identification of problems and communication between health facilities.","funding":"ICICI Centre for Child Health and Nutrition; Wellcome TrustWellcome TrustEuropean Commission [081052]","cited":63,"publisher":"BIOMED CENTRAL LTD","year":2012,"volume":"12","pages":10},{"authors":"Lueker, Justin; Bardhan, Ronita; Sarkar, Ahana; Norford, Leslie","title":"Indoor air quality among Mumbai's resettled populations: Comparing Dharavi slum to nearby rehabilitation sites","source":"BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"This study presents results from an experimental investigation of the severity and sources of household air pollution across two low-income housing archetypes in Mumbai.

Household surveys were conducted to understand aspects of occupant behavior that impact indoor air quality. Multi-pollutant logging sensors were installed inside units and in nearby outdoor locations to measure concentrations of particulate matter (PM2.5) and CO2. While rehabilitation architecture and gas cookstoves are often assumed to provide higher indoor air quality than in traditional slums, field monitoring and occupant behavior surveys demonstrated that indoor pollution levels were consistent across the two typologies even after infrastructure enhancements and ubiquitous gas cookstove usage. Indoor PM2.5 measurements ranged between 150 and 300 mu g/m(3), substantially higher than World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. PM2.5 indoor/outdoor (I/O) ratios spiked during cooking periods but were otherwise less than 1.0 in over half of logged instances in rehabilitation units, highlighting the role of particle deposition phenomena and ambient-sourced PM2.5 in indoor environments. To minimize the impact of both indoor and outdoor pollutant sources while respecting culturally-normative occupant behavior, this study points to the need for architectural design guidelines and enhanced indoor air quality interventions.","funding":"MIT Tata Center for Design and Technology; Ministry of Human Resource Development; Government of India (GoI) project CoE-FAST [14MHRD005]; IRCC-IIT Bombay Fund [16IRCC561015]","cited":48,"publisher":"PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD","year":2020,"volume":"167","pages":13},{"authors":"Zenteno Torres, Elizabeth; Sepulveda Munoz, Kimberly; Ahumada Gonzalez, Julio; Diaz Aros, Jose","title":"From insurgent citizenships to urban planners.

This study evaluates the project's effect on homicide rates according to time and interventions. Methods: Homicide rates were analyzed comparing five slums with interventions (S1-S5) to five grouped non-intervened slums (S0), with similar socioeconomic characteristics from 2002 to 2012. Poisson regression model estimates the effect of time of observation and the effect of time of exposure (in years) to a completed intervention, besides the overall risk ratio (RR).

In fact, NGOs quickly began following the rules and practices of informalized municipal administration. These findings are significant for those working on improving basic urban services because where incumbent actors in municipal governance can coordinate to undermine programmes, or alter them to their relative advantage, then participatory development programmes (as currently organized) lack fitness for purpose.

This wellbeing framework proves useful in understanding how community wellbeing is impacted by several negative factors: the perceptions of slums, the presence of systemic racism and growing inequality, and a range of environmental impacts arising from industrial and urban pollution, and environmental disasters. Within this mix of environmental and social impacts are links between poverty and exposure to environmental hazards, and effects of environmental racism. On the positive side, these threats to community wellbeing are countered to some extent through targeted measures carried out by the community association and its partnerships, and through beneficial governmental policy measures. Together, these responses help to reduce the detrimental effects of an unhealthy and dangerous environment, and of social concerns such as exclusion, poverty, urbanization and inequality. Key to the success of response measures are the contributions of the community leadership to improve the wellbeing of slum-dwellers by counterbalancing the effects of racism and social inequality, and implementing social programs and community facilities, thereby filling the gaps created by a lack of state support to slums. These actions illustrate what impoverished communities can do to improve livelihoods and wellbeing, and to combat problems such as environmental degradation and racial discrimination. This article also draws lessons for improving wellbeing analysis, particularly in slum communities, through a greater focus on (1) collective wellbeing and a community-focused view of wellbeing, (2) impacts of racism and inequality, and (3) interactions between community wellbeing and community leadership.","funding":"Robin Rigby Trust; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, through the Community Conservation Research Network; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR; community of Vila dos Pescadores","cited":33,"publisher":"ELSEVIER","year":2019,"volume":"13","pages":7},{"authors":"Ssemugabo, Charles; Wafula, Solomon Tsebeni; Ndejjo, Rawlance; Osuret, Jimmy; Musoke, David; Halage, Abdullah Ali","title":"Characteristics of sanitation and hygiene facilities in a slum community in Kampala, Uganda","source":"INTERNATIONAL HEALTH","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"Background: This study assessed characteristics of sanitation and hygiene facilities in a slum community in Kampala, Uganda. Methods: We conducted a household-based cross-sectional study among 395 households in Kasubi slum using a semi-structured questionnaire and observational checklist to collect data.

Currently, FS or its liquid fraction after dewatering is co-treated with sewage in conventional treatment plants. When dewatered, the solid stream is dried and stored further as the terminal treatment or is co-treated directly with organic solid wastes in composting or anaerobic digestion systems. To implement these, FS has to be collected and transported. Also, land is needed, but it is in most cases limited in slums or their vicinity. The collection and transport of FS from slums is costly due to lack of access, traffic congestion and long travel distances to treatment plants. Moreover, uncollected FS poses health risks and pollutes surface and/or ground water within slums. This review demonstrates that currently utilized technologies and practices fall short in various ways and discusses the possibility of minimizing FS management related costs, risks and pollution in urban slums by decentralized treatment and end-use. It also discusses the possible FS-derived end-products and their benefits to urban slum dwellers. Substitution of a part of natural materials (sand and clay) when building and/or biomass (firewood and charcoal) for cooking with FS derived end-products could multiply the benefits of improved sanitation to slum dwellers.

The present community-based study was undertaken in the urban slums of a city in Gujarat to determine the following parameters: (a) the prevalence and type of pathogenic intestinal parasites and (b) the availability of sanitary facilities in the study population. Materials and methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted in 2008, and the study participants were urban slum dwellers. Considering an expected infection prevalence of 30% among slum dwellers, an allowable error of 10% and an anticipated design effect of two, the sample size for the cluster design was set to 1800 participants from 30 clusters and 360 households (HHs). Stool samples were examined using both direct wet mount and the formalin-ether sedimentation concentration technique, followed by trichrome staining for protozoan cysts. Results: Toilet facilities were utilized by 56% of the HHs, while 44% of the HHs resorted to open air defecation. The overall prevalence rate of intestinal parasitic infections was 15.19%. Parasitic infections due to protozoa were observed in 70.71% of the study participants. Helminth infections were detected in 25.71% of the participants, and multiple parasitic infections were detected in 3.57%. Diarrhea was the most common complaint (9.56%) in the study population. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that poor sanitation and inadequate environmental conditions are the main determining factors that predispose the population to intestinal parasites.

Disease rates in Brazilian slums are incommensurate with the country's economic status and the existence of its universal healthcare system. Our study aimed to investigate what system issues may allow for disease persistence, focusing on issues surrounding access and utilization of primary and specialized healthcare services. Study design: This was a two-part (formative phase followed by implementation phase) qualitative study based on interviews and focus groups and analyzed via content analysis. Methods: One focus group and 17 in-depth interviews with community health workers, primary care providers, and cardiologists who serve slum residents in Brazil and six interviews with key informants (community health researchers and cardiologists) were performed. Interviews with community health workers and primary care providers were from a single heath post in the neighborhood of Liberdade, a populous and previously unstudied slum in Salvador. Cardiologists were recruited from tertiary care referral hospitals in Salvador. Results: Our findings revealed six major chronological categories/themes of issues and twenty subthemes that patients must overcome to avoid developing RHD or to have it successfully medically managed. Major themes include the effects of living in a slum (1), barriers to access and utilization of primary healthcare services (2), treatment in primary healthcare services (3), access/utilization of specialized healthcare services (4), treatment in specialized healthcare services (5), and certain systemic issues (6). Conclusion: Slums make residents sick in a manner of ways, and various bottlenecks impeding medical access to both primary care and specialty care exist, requiring multifaceted interventions. We detail major themes and finally suggest interventions that can allow for the health system to successfully eliminate RHD as a public health concern for slum residents.

However, in the process of urbanization and city development, researchers have focused merely on the crumbled infrastructure, crimes, and other social problems associated with slums. Studies have covered the adverse effects of these factors on property value, although this unmatched study is the first to examine the negative impact of slum proximity on the valuation of properties in the surrounding areas and on the rental value of houses located in Islamabad. The survey method is applied to obtain feedback from inhabitants, and the study incorporated the hedonic price model to assess rental values within a range of one kilometer from selected slum areas. The findings revealed that slum neighborhoods negatively impact sustainable house rental values, as compared with the rental values of houses located far away. Rents became higher as the distance from the slums increased. The results showed that having slums in the vicinity caused a decline of almost 10% in rent. However, the rental value of a similar house unit, located 500 meters away, was found to be almost 10% higher. In the semi-log model, house rental values increased by approximately 12.40% at a distance of one kilometer from slums, and vice versa. This study will use residents' feedback to help government officials and policymakers to resolve slum issues, which is essential for maintaining sustainable development and adequate city planning.

We assessed the influence of socio-demographic, economic and disease-related factors in health care seeking for child illnesses among slum dwellers of Nairobi, Kenya. A survey round of the Nairobi Urban Demographic Surveillance System (NUDSS) generated information on 2-week child morbidity, illness symptoms, perceived illness severity and use of modern health services. During this round of data collection, interviewers visited a total of 15 174 households, where 3015 children younger than 5 years lived. Of the 999 (33.1%) children who were reported to have been sick, medical care of some sort was sought for 604 (60.5%). Lack of finances (49.6%) and a perception that the illness was not serious (28.1%) were the main reasons given for failure to seek health care outside the home. Health care seeking was most common for sick children in the youngest age group (0 - 11 months). Caretakers sought medical care more frequently for diarrhoea symptoms than for coughing and even more so when the diarrhoea was associated with fever. Perception of illness severity was strongly associated with health care seeking. Household income was significantly associated with health care seeking up to certain threshold levels, above which its effects stabilized. Improving caretaker skills to recognize danger signs in child illnesses may enhance health-seeking behaviour.

During the summer, real-time PM2.5, Lung Deposited Surface Area and Black Carbon were also measured (n(ind) = 8,n(out)= 8). Additionally, detailed questionnaire surveys on housing, household and health characteristics were conducted in similar to 500 homes of the seven Mumbai slums. More than 60% of the homes in slums had no separate kitchen or cross-ventilation, especially in low socioeconomic status homes. Respiratory and cardiovascular diseases were reported in 15% and 6% of the households, respectively, with a higher prevalence in homes burning mosquito coils. Significantly higher indoor PM2.5 was observed during winter (111 +/- 30 mu g/m(3)) than summer (36 +/- 12 mu g/m(3)). Although liquefied petroleum gas was the only indoor cooking fuel reported, the winter-time indoor levels were similar or higher than the concentrations observed in other urban slum homes using biomass fuels for cooking. This could be attributed to the alarmingly high winter-time ambient PM2.5 (192 +/- 80 mu g/m(3)) and its larger contribution to indoor PM2.5 (81%).

Currently, most national health systems in SSA are not adequately prepared for this epidemic. This is especially so in slum settlements where access to formal healthcare and resources is limited. Objective: To develop and introduce a model of cardiovascular prevention in the slums of Nairobi by integrating public health and private sector approaches. Study design: Two non-profit organizations that conduct public health research, Amsterdam Institute for Global Health and Development (AIGHD) and African Population and Health Research Center (APHRC), collaborated with private-sector Boston Consulting Group (BCG) to develop a service delivery package for CVD prevention in slum settings. A theoretic model was designed based on the integration of public and private sector approaches with the focus on costs and feasibility. Results: The final model includes components that aim to improve community awareness, a home-based screening service, patient and provider incentives to seek and deliver treatment specifically for hypertension, and adherence support. The expected outcomes projected by this model could prove potentially cost effective and affordable (1 USD/person/year). The model is currently being implemented in a Nairobi slum and is closely followed by key stakeholders in Kenya including the Ministry of Health, the World Health Organization (WHO), and leading non-governmental organizations (NGOs). Conclusion: Through the collaboration of public health and private sectors, a theoretically cost-effective model was developed for the prevention of CVD and is currently being implemented in the slums of Nairobi. If results are in line with the theoretical projections and first impressions on the ground, scale-up of the service delivery package could be planned in other poor urban areas in Kenya by relevant policymakers and NGOs.","funding":"Academic Medical Centre Foundation","cited":25,"publisher":"TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","year":2013,"volume":"6","pages":6},{"authors":"Gago-Cortes, Carmen; Novo-Corti, Isabel","title":"Sustainable development of urban slum areas in northwestern Spain","source":"MANAGEMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"Purpose - The persistence of shanty towns in cities is a major public issue due to the situation of poverty and abandonment of its inhabitants.

The method chosen to try to understand the functioning of slums as feelings of communities was to think a musical subgenre that expresses a process of identity micro-location, shifting his gaze to areas where emerging new inter-subjective experiences and negotiate other cultural values.","cited":43,"publisher":"UNIV FEDERAL ESPIRITO SANTO","year":2017,"issue":"31","pages":34},{"authors":"Bird, Julia; Montebruno, Piero; Regan, Tanner","title":"Life in a slum: understanding living conditions in Nairobi's slums across time and space","source":"OXFORD REVIEW OF ECONOMIC POLICY","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"This paper overviews the role of slums in urban Africa, focusing on Nairobi.

However, improvements to building quality, public-service provision, and socio-economic characteristics are mostly outpacing those seen in the formal sector. Measures such as child health and school attendance have caught up or are on pace to catch up in the near future with the formal sector, while improvements in building quality and service provision are advancing more slowly.

In Ghana, both these factors come into play as women living in slums bear the brunt of the impacts. In spite of this, the majority of research in gender and climate change adaptation has focused on rural communities to the detriment of their poor urban counterparts. Using a critical feminist intersectional approach, this study investigates how the interplay between gender, socio-economic, institutional and place-based factors shapes vulnerability to climate change in three slums in urban Accra, Ghana. The results demonstrate that while climate change poses serious environmental hazards to all residents of slums, their perceptions and knowledge regarding the causes and impacts of these hazards are differentiated by gender, age, educational status and place-based variables, with women generally showing a lower level of awareness about climate change than their male counterparts. The results indicate further that irrespective of age, educational attainment and where people live, women were found to be overall more vulnerable, despite experiencing similar levels of exposure as the men, by virtue of their limited access to productive resources, poor conditions of housing, low participation in adaptation decision-making, as well as the heavy domestic responsibilities placed on them. We conclude that it is imperative for adaptation policy makers to formulate and implement appropriate adaptive measures in a gender-sensitive and context-specific manner to respond to the different vulnerabilities faced by different categories of social groups and communities in cities of the Global South.","funding":"University of Adelaide","cited":75,"publisher":"SPRINGER HEIDELBERG","year":2019,"volume":"19","issue":"1","pages":13},{"authors":"Shekhar, Raj; Bhar, Ditipriya; Singh, Chandramani","title":"Awareness, Knowledge and Practices of Contraceptive Methods among Married Males of Slums of Phulwarisharif block of Patna District, Bihar","source":"INDIAN JOURNAL OF COMMUNITY HEALTH","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"Background: Even though India was the first country to launch family planning programme, population growth rate of India is still higher.

The study aim was to assess knowledge of tuberculosis and identify the associated socio-demographic determinants, in order to inform tailored interventions for advocacy, communication and social mobilisation in three urban-slum communities of Uganda. Methods: A cross-sectional survey of 1361 adults between April and October 2011. Data was analyzed by descriptive statistics. Adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) of potential determinants of tuberculosis (TB) knowledge were estimated by multivariable ordinal logistic regression using Stata 11.2 software. Results: We found low knowledge of TB cause (26.7%); symptoms (46.8%), transmission (54.3%), prevention (34%) and free treatment (35%).

I also find that overall population access to water and sanitation is associated with lower CIWB.

The hypothesis that care-seeking sites for maternal morbidity mirror those used for antenatal care was also tested. We analysed data for 10,754 births in 48 slum areas and interviewed mothers about their illnesses and care-seeking during pregnancy. Institutional care-seeking was high across the board (>80%), and higher for 'trigger' symptoms suggestive of complications (>88%). Private-sector care was preferred, and increased with socio-economic status, although public providers also played an important role. Most women sought treatment at the same site they received their antenatal care, most were treated within 2 days, and less than 2% were referred to other providers. Our findings suggest that poor women in Mumbai recognise symptoms of obstetric complications and the need for health care. However, that more than 80% also sought care for minor conditions implies that the tendency to seek institutional care for serious conditions reflects a broader picture of care-seeking for all illnesses.

But there is little in the research literature about education of children who live in slums and it is doubtful whether they are covered in official statistics such as those on enrolment rates. This paper addresses this gap with information from a 2008 survey of around 1600 slum households. Most had incomes of less than US$1 per day per person, and faced problems including flooding, poor housing, and risk of eviction. A wide range of school types provided education to children from the study areas, but this varied a lot between different slums. The paper focuses on how parents and children made decisions about schooling, in a context where the options on offer are less than ideal. Overall around 70% of children were enrolled in primary school. Most were in government or NGO schools, with minorities in madrasas and private schools. Almost half of the school-going children were supplementing their classes with private tuition. Regression analysis shows that children from wealthier households and with more highly educated parents, were more likely to be in school, more likely to be in a private school rather than other types, and less likely to be in an NGO school. However, location and the range of schools on offer were also important. The paper concludes by considering how government and NGOs could improve provision to the urban poor. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Objective: To assess and report the core indicators on sanitation and drinking water from urban slums using standardized WHO and UNICEF questionnaires. Materials and Methodology: The present observational cross-sectional study was conducted for 2 months i.e., from September 2019 to October 2019 in urban slums of Trikuta Nagar, a field practice area of Department of Community Medicine, GMC Jammu. Information was gathered from the head of the household as well as from other household members. About 50% of the population were selected randomly by lottery method i.e., 450 and consist of 112 households. However, at the time of the study, only 100 households were assessed because of the nonavailability of household members and some houses were locked at the time of the interview. Results: The study revealed that nearly 62% of families were of a joint type and most of the families were headed by male members. Around 82.5% of the slum members used water for drinking from improved source but only 21.5% of the household members used adequate water treatment method i.e., boiling.

Results: Increasing BMI is significantly and positively associated with frequency of watching television, having diabetes, age, wealth index, and residency status in the areas of New Delhi, Andhra Pradesh, or Tamil Nadu. Conclusion: Although belonging to a scheduled tribe was not associated with changes in BMI, unadjusted rates suggest that tribal status may be worthy of deeper investigation.

BRAC, a large NGO in Bangladesh, is a pioneer in using female volunteer CHWs as core workers in its successful health programmes. After 25 years of implementing the CHW model in rural areas, BRAC is now using CHWs in urban slums of Dhaka through Manoshi, a community-based maternal and child health project. However, high dropout rates among CHWs in the slums suggested a need to better understand factors associated with their retention, and consequently recommend strategies for increasing their retention. Methods This mixed-method study included a case-control design to assess factors relating to the retention of volunteer CHWs, and focus group discussions (FGDs) to explore solutions to problems. In total, 542 current and 146 dropout CHWs participated in the survey. Six FGDs were held with groups of current and groups of dropout CHWs. Results Financial incentives were the main factor linked to CHW retention. CHWs who joined with the expectation of income were almost twice as likely to remain as CHWs. This finding was reinforced by the inverse association between wealth quintile of the CHWs and retention; the poorest CHWs were significantly more likely to stay in the programme than the richest. However, social prestige, community approval and household responsibilities were important non-financial factors associated with CHW retention. Restructuring and expansion of existing financial incentives to better compensate CHWs were recommended by CHWs to improve their retention. Conclusions Factors found to be important in this study are similar to those from earlier studies in rural areas. While the data indicate that financial incentives are the most commonly discussed factor regarding CHW retention in urban slums, the results also suggest other avenues that could be strengthened to improve their retention.","funding":"Bill & Melinda Gates FoundationBill & Melinda Gates Foundation","cited":30,"publisher":"OXFORD UNIV PRESS","year":2012,"volume":"27","issue":"6","pages":10},{"authors":"Singh, Sanjeev; Sahu, Damodar; Agrawal, Ashish; Jeyaseelan, Lakshmanan; Nadaraj, Ambily; Vashi, Meeta Dhaval","title":"Coverage, quality, and correlates of childhood immunization in slums under national immunization program of India: A cross-sectional study","source":"HELIYON","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"Adequate and quality immunization coverage plays a key role in controlling the outbreaks of vaccine preventable diseases.

A community based cross-sectional survey was conducted. Parents or caretakers of 550 eligible children aged 12-23 months were interviewed using a structured interview schedule. Regression analysis was used to detect correlates of full immunization coverage (children who received one dose each of BCG, measles, and three doses each of DPT, OPV, and HBV by his/her first birthday) and of quality immunization coverage (children who received primary vaccines at appropriate age and intervals as mentioned above and had filled immunization card).

In fact, arguably the world's first began in Calcutta in 1876 and ran until 1910. It was sui generis. Like recent programmes, Calcutta's prioritized sanitary infrastructure over dwelling repairs; unlike them, it lacked resident participation. Inspired by sanitary initiatives in Britain, it was motivated by public health concerns, especially for Europeans; unusually, it had precise geographical foci. It involved the extension of sewers; of water lines to standpipes, wash stations, and public latrines; the filling in of tanks (ponds) used for washing and cooking; the closing of domestic wells; street cleaning and street widening.

Savings groups also draw inspiration from visiting other savings groups, including those that have large, successful partnerships with local governments.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of health promotion program on improving lifestyle of school children living in slum areas. Design: A quasi -experimental design was used. Setting: The study was conducted at two governmental primary schools in Azbat Elwalda, in Helwan Governorate Sample: A stratified multi-stage cluster random sample was used for selection of school children in slum areas, the total number of governmental primary schools in Azbat Elwalda are ( 3 ), two were chosen randomly. One class from fifth grade and one from sixth grade were selected randomly from each school. The total number of children for two schools were 200 (both sexes). Tools: 3 tools were used 1) A structured interviewing questionnaire was used to assess students socio-demographic characteristics, students' perception of social and physical environment of school, students' common health problems during the past two years and students' knowledge about healthy life style. These tools were used before and after program. 2) A physical examination to assess the student from head to toe. 3) An observational checklist for assessing in and out school's environment. Results: the study confirms that diseases of respiratory system had the highest frequencies among the students as follows: less than two fifths for common cold, more than one third for tonsillitis and bronchitis and more than one quarter for influenza. There was difference between before and after program implementation concerning students' health promoting life style, perception of social and physical school environment. The differences were statistically significant for all of variables (P = < 0.001). Conclusion: The study concluded that students perception improved toward their social, physical school environment and their knowledge about healthy life style after implementing the health promotion program. This improvement was proved statistically.

Such vulnerabilities have been linked to rapid urbanization, environmental degradation and weak disaster response, but little attention is paid to the factors that engender these problems in the first place or to why the poor have persistently been at greater risk. Poverty does not always mean vulnerability. Often several elements come into play to exacerbate conditions of impoverishment and susceptibility to risks. By using a political ecology framework, this paper shows that limited access to housing and weak housing rights are two crucial factors that have pushed the urban poor not only to encroach on hazardous landscapes but also to adopt environmentally intolerable coping and livelihood strategies which undermine the biophysical integrity of land and human settlements and also erode natural resilience against flooding. This relationship between housing rights and flooding is explored by a historical review of land and housing policy in Nigeria and its links to slum development and expansion. A mixed method approach involving a household survey, interviews, and focus group discussions, was employed to generate primary data. The results show that conventional approaches to flood prevention have masked structural inequality and social stigma contributing to high vulnerability and low adaptive capacity in slum communities. To boost adaptation, a number of actions are required including eliminating marginalization in housing and land use, promoting good urban governance, and fostering participatory environmental management.

In slum communities, water supply is insufficient but also highly contaminated; therefore, ensuring that the safe water chain is maintained by households is paramount to preventing water-related diseases. This study aimed at assessing knowledge and practices of households on safe water chain maintenance in slum communities in Kampala City, Uganda.MethodsThis was a community-based cross-sectional study carried out among 395 households in slum communities in Kampala, Uganda. Data were collected using a semi-structured questionnaire. Prevalence ratios (PRs) and their 95% confidence intervals were used as a measure of association between safe water chain management and associated knowledge and practice factors. The PRs were obtained using a multivariable modified Poisson regression with logarithm as the link function, with robust standard errors.ResultsMajority (76.7%, 303/395) ofthe households collected their water from a piped water system and paid for the water (72.9%, 288/395). Almost all (97.2%, 384/395) of the participants said that they knew the dangers associated with drinking unsafe water, boiled their drinking water (95.4%, 377/395), and used storage containers that minimize contamination (97.0%, 383/395). However, only (32.4%, 128/395) of the households satisfactorily maintained the safe water chain. Female- (adjusted PR=1.82, 95% CI (1.19-2.78)) and student-led households (adjusted PR=1.58, 95% CI (1.03-2.41)) and those whose heads had attained post-primary education (adjusted PR=1.48, 95% CI (1.02-2.17)) were more likely to satisfactorily maintain the safe water chain.

Aims and objectives: To study the social health problem and its determinant among adolescent girls aged 15-19 years living in slums of Dibrugarh town, Assam. Materials and methods: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 300 adolescent girls aged 15-19 years residing in slums of Dibrugarh town, Assam during the period from June 2014 to May 2015. Results: Mean age of adolescent girls was 16.57 +/- 1.45 years. Majority were Hindu (67.7%), belonged to nuclear family (74.3%) and had socio-economic status IV (53%). 1.3% were illiterate and 8.4% were married. Overall thinness and stunting were prevalent among 39.4% and 33%, respectively. Stunting decreased significantly with increase in age and overall thinness decreased significantly with attainment of higher socio-economic status, higher educational status and nuclear family. In this study, depression was prevalent among 7% and mild anxiety among 12.7% of adolescent girls. Depression increased significantly with increase in age and with lower socio-economic class. Exposure of domestic violence was reported among 2.3% and it had significant association with socio-economic status.

HIV testing in Kenya follows both the voluntary counselling and testing (VCT) and provider initiated testing and counselling (PITC) models. However, little is known about the individual experiences of undergoing an HIV test in the two testing models. This study provides experiential evidence of undergoing an HIV test in a resource poor urban slum setting. Methods The study explored testing experiences and challenges faced in respect to ensuring the 3 Cs (consent, counselling and confidentiality), using in-depth interviews (N = 41) with HIV-infected men and women in two slum settlements of Nairobi City. The in-depth interview respondents were aged above 18 years with 56% being females. All interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed and then translated into English. The transcribed data were analysed using thematic analysis method. Results The respondent HIV-testing experiences were varied and greatly shaped by circumstances and motivation for HIV testing. The findings show both positive and negative experiences, with sporadic adherence to the 3Cs principle in both HIV testing models. Although some respondents were satisfied with the HIV testing process, a number of them raised a number of concerns, with instances of coercion and testing without consent being reported. Conclusion The 3Cs (consent, counselling and confidentiality) principle must underlie HIV testing and counselling practices in order to achieve positive testing outcomes. The study concludes that adherence to the 3Cs during HIV testing contributes to both the individual and public health good - irrespective of whether testing is initiated by the individual or by the health provider.","funding":"Wellcome TrustWellcome TrustEuropean Commission [078471/Z/05/A]","cited":37,"publisher":"BMC","year":2019,"volume":"19","issue":"1","pages":8},{"authors":"Aziz, Tamer Abdel; Shawket, Indjy M.","title":"New strategy of upgrading slum areas in developing countries using vernacular trends to achieve a sustainable housing development","source":"IMPACT OF INTEGRATED CLEAN ENERGY ON THE FUTURE OF THE MEDITERRANEAN ENVIRONMENT","language":"English","doc":"Proceedings Paper","abstract":"Vernacular architecture is surely a contradiction in terms. The vernacular is the unconscious work of craftsmen based on knowledge accumulated over generations the very opposite of architecture, which involves a premeditated design process with a conscious appeal to the intellect.

In fact, many of the architects featured here reject the concept of style. Instead, describe their intention to reflect by analogous inspiration the characteristics of local buildings, their scale in particular, whether they have chosen to concentrate on the use of materials, the landscape, the local culture or even no more than the idea of continuity with the past.

In May 2005, at the behest of the Government of Zimbabwe the infamous Operation Restore Order, a house demolition campaign left more than 700 thousand people homeless. Nearly a decade later, there are increased opportunities for improvement and change in the lives of the urban poor in Harare, Zimbabwe's capital city. The purpose of the paper is to present how the Harare Slum Upgrading Programme is creating and strengthening municipal and community partnerships to tackle city challenges in an inclusive manner. This research indicates the housing struggles of the urban poor and the emerging City-community engagement in urban services provision (water, sanitation, tenure security and roads) and changing,municipal attitudes towards the urban poor. In particular, the article presents participatory urban planning and development, slum upgrading institutional structure, profiling and enumeration, and slum upgrading impacts (resilience of the urban poor, living in slums without fear, expansive pool of beneficiaries, review of planning regulations and land ownership) as major issues promoting inclusive municipal governance. Inclusivity is implemented through incremental development, which is allowing people to settle on land first and access municipal services gradually over time. Two main factors explain such positive steps towards inclusive governance in Harare. First are indications of gradual institutional change in which the City of Harare's governance culture is changing through 'opening up' and embracing the urban poor. Second, over the years, the urban poor have built a strong and vibrant alliance which is acting as a medium of participation in City governance. The paper concludes that slum upgrading sustainability at city-wide level requires active City participation and institutionalisation as opposed to a project based approach. Lastly, addressing concerns of the urban poor is susceptible to political contestations, requiring strong impartiality to counter such forces. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

A number of ground truthing areas were used to classify the resulting datasets and to identify lacunarity ranges which are typical for settlement types that combine high density housing and small dwelling size - features characteristic for urban slums in India. It was discovered that the line detection algorithm is advantageous over principal component analysis in providing suitable binary datasets for lacunarity analysis as it is less sensitive to spectral variability within mosaicked imagery. The resulting slum location map constitutes an efficient tool in identifying particularly overcrowded areas of the city and can be used as a reliable source in vulnerability and resilience assessments at a later stage.

A major objective of this policy is to provide a site for the resettlement of slum residents. As policymakers justify poverty alleviation and social inclusion to advance their agenda, residents facing displacement have shown substantial resistance to these resettlement programs. Tamesna, the second new city established under this policy, was mainly established to provide a resettlement site for approximately three thousand households living in informal settlements in the surrounding rural commune of Sidi Yahya Zaer (SYZ). Only two-thirds of the households had resettled in summer 2017, and the resettlement process was delayed as some residents refused to participate. This paper questions the factors that influenced the refusal of many households to participate in the resettlement process that was ostensibly designed to meet their housing needs. Using a combination of ethnography, archive review and interviews with the local population, and housing developers, the paper examines the different circumstances and factors that shape residents' reactions to the resettlement process.

It is a neglected issue in women's health, especially in urban slums in Nepal and globally. This study was designed to better understand the IPV experienced by young pregnant women in urban slums of the Kathmandu Valley, as well as to identify their coping strategies, care and support seeking behaviours. Womens' views on ways to prevent IPV were also addressed. Methods: 20 young pregnant women from 13 urban slums in the Kathmandu valley were recruited purposively for this qualitative study, based on pre-defined criteria. In-depth interviews were conducted and transcribed, with qualitative content analysis used to analyse the transcripts. Results: 14 respondents were survivors of violence in urban slums. Their intimate partner(s) committed most of the violent acts. These young pregnant women were more likely to experience different forms of violence (psychological, physical and sexual) if they refused to have sex, gave birth to a girl, or if their husband had alcohol use disorder. The identification of foetal gender also increased the experience of physical violence at the prenatal stage. Interference from in-laws prevented further escalation of physical abuse. The most common coping strategy adopted to avoid violence among these women was to tolerate and accept the husbands' abuse because of economic dependence. Violence survivors sought informal support from their close family members. Women suggested multiple short and long term actions to reduce intimate partner violence such as female education, economic independence of young women, banning identification of foetal gender during pregnancy and establishing separate institutions within their community to handle violence against young pregnant women. Conclusions: Diversity in the design and implementation of culturally and socially acceptable interventions might be effective in addressing violence against young pregnant women in humanitarian settings such as urban slums. These include, but are not limited to, treatment of alcohol use disorder, raising men's awareness about pregnancy, addressing young women's economic vulnerability, emphasising the role of health care professionals in preventing adverse consequences resulting from gender selection technologies and working with family members of violence survivors.","cited":51,"publisher":"BMC","year":2016,"volume":"16","pages":10},{"authors":"Zanuzdana, Arina; Khan, Mobarak; Kraemer, Alexander","title":"Housing Satisfaction Related to Health and Importance of Services in Urban Slums: Evidence from Dhaka, Bangladesh","source":"SOCIAL INDICATORS RESEARCH","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"Quality of housing plays one of the key roles in a public health research, since inadequate housing may have direct or indirect negative impact on health.

In this context, using the guidelines of the World Health Organization (WHO), this study assessed the CF practices among mothers in four selected slums (Tejgoan, Rayerbazar, Beribadh, and Jafrabad) of Dhaka city. This descriptive study, conducted during January-June 2010, included 120 mother-child pairs from the selected slums. Samples were selected conveniently, and the sociodemographic profiles of mothers in the four slums were similar. The mean (standard deviation) age of the children was 14.68 +/- 5.55 months. A questionnaire, developed following the guidelines of WHO for CF practices, was used for collecting data. Twenty-seven (23%) mothers were exclusively breastfeeding (EBF) their children. Among non-EBF mothers, 15 (16%) started CF after the recommended time. At 6-8 months of age, 2 (40%) of the EBF and 12 (67%) of the non-EBF mothers gave complementary foods twice a day to their children. In both the groups-9-11 months of age-about 70% mothers gave complementary foods twice a day to their children. The frequency of CF was acceptable (3 times a day) in 13 (81%) of the EBF and 32 (56%) of the non-EBF children at 12-23 months of age. Complementary foods given by 24 (89%) of the EBF and 86 (93%) of the non-EBF mothers to their children were not adequate in energy contents. Two (7%) EBF and 16 (17%) non-EBF mothers did not wash their hands after defaecation. Three (11%) EBF and 24 (26%) non-EBF mothers did not properly clean their hands and utensils before feeding. Nine (33%) EBF mothers did not wash their children's hands. Fifty (54%) non-EBF mothers also did not do this. Feeding with psychosocial care practices was not perfect in either of the groups.

Individual factors related to the husband-namely, poor socioeconomic status, use of alcohol, extramarital relations, and visiting red light districts-increased the risk of violence. The following relationship factors were associated with a higher risk of violence: age difference of 5 years or less between spouses, husband's irregular contribution to family expenses, not sharing information about his personal expenses, manifestation of controlling behaviors, and longer duration of marriage. The study concludes that adverse socioeconomic conditions create low self-esteem and insecurity among men, who find expression in aberrant behaviors, and violence is used as a compensatory behavior. Interventions, therefore, need to go beyond the victim-centric approach and address partner and relationship issues for greater impact.","cited":54,"publisher":"SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC","year":2009,"volume":"24","issue":"7","pages":17},{"authors":"Sutiyarsi, Tatik; Koestoer, Raldi H.; Susiloningtyas, Dewi","title":"The challenge of slums toward a sustainable city","source":"SOUTHEAST ASIAN GEOGRAPHY ASSOCIATION (SEAGA)","language":"English","doc":"Proceedings Paper","abstract":"An increasing number of urban dwellers tend to encrich land for settlements of restricted urban area to form slums.

Four major themes emerged: (1) financial hardship influencing health; (2) urbanized lifestyle affecting diet; (3) tobacco and sweetened tea as cornerstones of social life; and (4) health-seeking behavior utilizing local resources. One notable finding was that even with general economic improvement, respondents perceived poverty to be one of the major causes of NCDs. A promising finding for potentially curbing NCDs was the current trend for women to walk for exercise contrary to the commonly held notion that urban dwellers generally lead sedentary lifestyles. This study described how urban slum dwellers in Dhaka, experiencing a transition from a traditional to urbanized lifestyle, perceived their daily practices in relation to NCDs and nutrition.

However, disparities in healthcare have proved to be the biggest challenge for implementing primary care in poor-urban resource settings. In this study, we assessed the level of access to primary healthcare services and associated factors in urban slums in Nairobi-Kenya.MethodsThe data were drawn from the Lown scholars' study of 300 randomly selected households in Viwandani slums (Nairobi, Kenya), between June and July 2018. Access to primary care was measured using Penchansky and Thomas' model. Access index was constructed using principal component analysis and recorded into tertiles with categories labeled as poor, moderate, and highest. Generalized ordinal logistic regression analysis was used to determine the factors associated with access to primary care. The adjusted odds ratios (AOR) and 95% confidence intervals were used to interpret the strength of associations.ResultsThe odds of being in the highest access tertile versus the combined categories of lowest and moderate access tertile were three times higher for males than female-headed households (AOR 3.05 [95% CI 1.47-6.37]; p <.05). Households with an average quarterly out-of-pocket healthcare expenditure of <greater than or equal to>USD 30 had significantly lower odds of being in the highest versus combined categories of lowest and moderate access tertile compared to those spending <= USD 5 (AOR 0.36 [95% CI 0.18-0.74]; p <.05). Households that sought primary care from private facilities had significantly higher odds of being in the highest versus combined categories of lowest and moderate access tertiles compared to those who sought care from public facilities (AOR 6.64 [95% CI 3.67-12.01]; p <.001).ConclusionIn Nairobi slums in Kenya, living in a female-headed household, seeking care from a public facility, and paying out-of-pocket for healthcare are significantly associated with low access to primary care. Therefore, the design of the UHC program in this setting should prioritize quality improvement in public health facilities and focus on policies that encourage economic empowerment of female-headed households to improve access to primary healthcare.","cited":46,"publisher":"BMC","year":2020,"volume":"20","issue":"1","pages":9},{"authors":"Wong, Joshua M.; Nyachieo, Dhillon O.; Benzekri, Noelle A.; Cosmas, Leonard; Ondari, Daniel; Yekta, Shahla; Montgomery, Joel M.; Williamson, John M.; Breiman, Robert F.","title":"Sustained high incidence of injuries from burns in a densely populated urban slum in Kenya: An emerging public health priority","source":"BURNS","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"Introduction: Ninety-five percent of burn deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs); however, longitudinal household-level studies have not been done in urban slum settings, where overcrowding and unsafe cook stoves may increase likelihood of injury. Methods: Using a:prospective, population-based disease surveillance system in the urban slum of Kibera in Kenya, we examined the incidence of household-level burns of all severities from 2006-2011. Results: Of approximately 28,500 enrolled individuals (6000 households), we identified 3072 burns. The overall incidence was 27.9/1000 person-years-of-observation. Children <5 years old sustained burns at 3.8-fold greater rate compared to (p < 0.001) those >= 5 years old. Females >= 5 years old sustained burns at a rate that was 1.35-fold (p < 0.001) greater than males within the same age distribution. Hospitalizations were uncommon (0.65% of all burns). Conclusions: The incidence of burns, 10-fold greater than in most published reports from Africa and Asia, suggests that such injuries may contribute more significantly than previously thought to morbidity in LMICs, and may be increased by urbanization. As migration from rural areas into urban slums rapidly increases in many African countries, characterizing and addressing the rising burden of burns is likely to become a public health priority.

Fifty-five pit latrines were selected from the five divisions of Kampala city using stratified random sampling. Data collected included: number of users, frequency of emptying, years taken since last emptying, type of non-faecal materials deposited, cross-sectional dimensions of the pit, rate of sludge degradation and geo-physical factors of pit location. Methods used were: field surveys, questionnaires and key informant interviews plus on-site depth measurement. Mass loss tests to investigate the rate of sludge degradation were carried out in the laboratory at moisture content levels similar to those in pit latrines. Sludge accumulation rates were calculated using volume of sludge in the pit, number of users and time taken since last emptying. Statistical analyses included correlation and one-way ANOVA. Results revealed that number of users and type of material deposited in the pit latrines, especially non-faecal matter, had a significant (p < 0.05) effect on sludge accumulation rate. Public pit latrines with a higher number of users had lower sludge accumulation rates and this was attributed to greater degradation taking place and greater restriction on entry of non-faecal matter. The rate of sludge degradation was higher at 90-100% than 80-90% moisture content, due to better degradation conditions. Tighter restrictions on non-faecal material deposition into pit latrines are recommended to reduce filling rates of pit latrines in slum areas.","funding":"Sanitation Research Fund for Africa Project; Water Research Commission (South Africa); Bill and Melinda Gates FoundationBill & Melinda Gates Foundation","cited":24,"publisher":"WATER RESEARCH COMMISSION","year":2016,"volume":"42","issue":"3","pages":6},{"authors":"Maticka-Tyndale, Eleanor; Barnett, Jessica Penwell; Trocaire","title":"Exploring the Relationship Between Stigma, Stigma Challenges, and Disclosure Among Slum-Dwelling Survivors of Intimate Partner Violence in Kenya","source":"VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"This article uses survey data from 131 women living in urban slums in Kenya to explore associations between stigma, stigma challenges, empowerment, and disclosure of intimate partner violence (IPV).

A package of interventions based on extended clinic hours, vaccinator training, active surveillance, and community participation was piloted in two slum areas of Dhaka, and resulted in an increase in valid fully immunized children (FIC) from 43% pre-intervention to 99% post-intervention. Methods: Cost data and stakeholder perspectives were collected January-February 2010 via document review and 10 key stakeholders interviews to estimate the financial and opportunity costs of the intervention, including uncompensated time, training and supervision costs. Results: The total economic cost of the 1-year intervention was $18,300, comprised of external management and supervision (73%), training (11%), coordination costs (1%), uncompensated staff time and clinic costs (2%), and communications, supplies and other costs (13%). An estimated 874 additional children were correctly and fully immunized due to the intervention, at an average cost of $20.95 per valid FIC. Key stakeholders ranked extended clinic hours and vaccinator training as the most important components of the intervention. External supervision was viewed as the most important factor for the intervention's success but also the costliest. All stakeholders would like to reinstate the intervention because it was effective, but additional funding would be needed to make the intervention sustainable. Conclusion: Targeting slum populations with an intensive immunization intervention was highly effective but would nearly triple the amount spent on immunization per FIC in slum areas. Those committed to increasing vaccination coverage for hard-to-reach children need to be prepared for substantially higher costs to achieve results.

In participatory slum-upgrading programmes, slum dwellers are treated as partners, instead of recipients of the services that are provided to mitigate their deprivations. The concept thrives on the willingness and ability of slum dwellers to pay for the services. The ability of slum dwellers to pay for services, unlike their willingness to pay, has received limited research attentions. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to assess the willingness and ability of residents of a slum settlement in Kumasi in Ghana to pay for utility services. Semi-structured interview schedules were used to gather primary data from a total of 276 households. The survey data were supplemented with data from key informant interviews and focus group discussions. The results show that almost nine out of every ten households were willing to pay for water and electricity services, if these services would be supplied to them directly by the state providers. The exploitation of the residents by unregulated utility services providers partly explains their willingness to pay for the utility services. These service providers charged almost 14 times the official tariffs. The results further show that all the households who were willing to pay were also capable of paying for the services without compromising their ability to afford other life essentials. The study concludes that slum regularisation policies, programmes and projects could be designed to be incremental and participatory by making the slum dwellers, partners and drivers of the upgrading process.","cited":43,"publisher":"SPRINGER","year":2018,"volume":"20","issue":"6","pages":20},{"authors":"Nayak, N; Gupta, SK; Murthy, GVS; Satpathy, G; Mohanty, S","title":"Community-based investigation of an outbreak of acute viral conjunctivitis in urban slums","source":"TROPICAL MEDICINE & INTERNATIONAL HEALTH","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"Nine hundred and sixteen people from 143 randomly selected households were included in this community-based investigation of an outbreak of acute viral conjunctivitis in urban slum communities of Delhi in 1994.

Indeed, shanty towns continue to grow in major cities: in Manila, nearly half of the population actually lives in over 500 slums located near public dumps or swamps [3]. Millions of children try to survive in these conditions: malnutrition, disease, forced labor, violence and, obviously, school dropouts are part of their daily lives. Education for All is a global priority to overcome poverty. But access to formal education remains almost impossible for all these street children. Children from disadvantaged backgrounds face more cognitive, emotional and social disorders. They probably experience more emotional and attentional difficulties [4; 5]. However, some institutions try to support the development of these children, offering them the opportunity to incorporate a school structure. This is the case of Makabata School Foundation, Inc. (MSFI) which hosts, in Pasig City, one hundred children from the slums of Manila. It is a non-profit foundation whose objectives are to help less fortunate Filipino children to study for free, to provide them a holistic, formal and non-formal education, to inculcate them human dignity, to develop basic skills for out of-school youth and to establish a network for their future employment [6]. Our research focused on the case of these pupils. Our aim was to understand how the children we met and interviewed perceive their daily life and the role of the school on their development and future prospects. Are the difficulties associated with the daily reality of slums moderated by their schooling? How do these children juggle their daily life between educational opportunities and consequences of poverty? Our study is an empirical analysis based on the immersion of a researcher, during three months, within the Filipino school. While implementing participant observation, we collected data from ten students and six teachers. The drawing was used to approach pupils' representations of their experiences from different perspectives (family, living environment, school, future). The interview and questionnaire survey were used to complete our research and better understand their experiences. Data were quantitatively and qualitatively analyzed. Overall, MSFI schooled children seem to be happy despite their living conditions. We could consider that the schooling reduces the negative effects of the environment. However, our results do not fully confirm this hypothesis. The imagination seems to be very important for them and appears to be used in an attempt to manage and cope with the daily challenges. The projection into the future does not seem anxiogenic, although it appears very realistic. The role of the school seems ambiguous: on the one hand, children feel proud to have been chosen,  elected to integrate the school; on the other hand, this selection put the pressure on them. School success appears to be the only possibility to get out of the slums and to achieve a better future.

The heterogeneous and dynamic nature of slum communities limits the use of rigid slum definitions. A systematic and flexible approach to characterize, delineate and model urban slum structure at an operational resolution is essential to plan, deploy, and monitor interventions at the local and national level. Methods: We modeled the multi-dimensional structure of urban slums in the city of Salvador, a city of 3 million inhabitants in Brazil, by integrating census-derived socioeconomic variables and remotely-sensed land cover variables. We assessed the correlation between the two sets of variables using canonical correlation analysis, identified land cover proxies for the socioeconomic variables, and produced an integrated map of deprivation in Salvador at 30 m x 30 m resolution. Results: The canonical analysis identified three significant ordination axes that described the structure of Salvador census tracts according to land cover and socioeconomic features. The first canonical axis captured a gradient from crowded, low-income communities with corrugated roof housing to higher-income communities. The second canonical axis discriminated among socioeconomic variables characterizing the most marginalized census tracts, those without access to sanitation or piped water. The third canonical axis accounted for the least amount of variation, but discriminated between high-income areas with white-painted or tiled roofs from lower-income areas. Conclusions: Our approach captures the socioeconomic and land cover heterogeneity within and between slum settlements and identifies the most marginalized communities in a large, complex urban setting. These findings indicate that changes in the canonical scores for slum areas can be used to track their evolution and to monitor the impact of development programs such as slum upgrading.","funding":"FIC NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Fogarty International Center (FIC) [D43 TW000919, R25 TW009338, D43 TW00919] Funding Source: Medline; NIAID NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [R01 AI052473, T32 AI007404, U01 AI088752] Funding Source: Medline; PHS HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesUnited States Public Health Service [T32 A107404] Funding Source: Medline; FOGARTY INTERNATIONAL CENTERUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Fogarty International Center (FIC) [D43TW000919, R25TW009338] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [U01AI088752, T32AI007404, R01AI052473, R01AI121207] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic ScieNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE) [1229429] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","cited":35,"publisher":"BMC","year":2013,"volume":"12","pages":12},{"authors":"Ezeala-Adikaibe, Birinus A.; Onyekonwu, Chinwe; Okudo, Grace; Onodugo, Obinna; Ekenze, Stella; Orjioke, Casmir; Chime, Peter; Ezeanosike, Obum; Mbadiwe, Nkiru; Chikani, Mark; Okwara, Celestine; Ulasi, Ifeoma; Ijoma, Uchenna","title":"Prevalence of Primary Headaches in an Urban Slum in Enugu South East Nigeria: A Door-to-Door Survey","source":"HEADACHE","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"Objective/Background.-This study aims to determine the prevalence of primary headache disorders using the second edition of international classification of headache disorders among urban slum dwellers. Headache is a common neurological disorder and one of the most common reasons for visiting the neurology clinics in Nigeria. Low socioeconomic status has been linked with primary headaches. Factors that may precipitate and sustain headaches are common in Africa especially in urban slums. There are limited population based data on the prevalence of headache from Nigeria and other African countries. Methods.-A 3 phase cross-sectional descriptive study was done to survey at least 40% of the adult population (Igbos) living in an urban slum using the International Classification of Headache Disorders 2nd Edition (ICHD-I) criteria using a validated Igbo language adaptation (translation and back-translation into Igbo language) of a World Health Organization protocol for screening neurological disorders in the community. Results.-The lifetime prevalence of headache of any type was 66.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] 64.2-69.2), significantly higher in females (70.2% [95% CI 67.0-73.4]) than in males (62.3% [95% CI 58.5-66.1]; P = .0.002). The prevalence of primary headaches was also significantly lower in males than in females (44.9% [95% CI 45.5-53.3] vs 53.2% (95% CI 49.3-57.1), P = .002). Female (52.1%) drinkers had a statistically higher prevalence of primary headaches than male drinkers (43.6%; P = .004). The prevalence of migraine was 6.4% (95% CI 5.1-7.7); 7.5% (95% CI 5.6-9.4) in females and 5% (95% CI 3.3-6.7) in males (P = .058). Migraine with aura was similar in both males and females. Migraine without aura was significantly higher in females (5.7%) than males (3.1%) (P = .022). Tension-type headache (TTH) had an overall prevalence of 13.8% (95% CI 11.3-16.3), males 12.2% (95% CI 9.7-14.7), and females 15.1% (95% CI 12.6-17.6; P = .118.) The peak decade for all primary headaches was 20-29 years for males (49.8%) and 60-69 years for females (57.5%). Conclusion.-Headache is a common health problem in an urban slum in Enugu south east Nigeria where 66.7% of participants had experienced headache in their lifetime, and 49.4% had experienced primary headaches. The prevalence of migraine and TTH were 6.4% (5% in males and 7.5% in females) and 13.8% (12.2% in males and 15.1% in females), respectively. The peak ages of migraine and tension-type headache were 30-39 and 60-69 years, respectively. The prevalence of primary headaches was significantly higher among subjects who used alcohol significantly.","funding":"Medical Education Partnership Initiative in Nigeria (MEPIN) project - Fogarty International Center; Office of AIDS ResearchUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; National Human Genome Research Institute of the National Institute of Health, the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA); Office of the U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator [R24TW008878]","cited":35,"publisher":"WILEY","year":2014,"volume":"54","issue":"10","pages":10},{"authors":"Pahwa, Smriti; Kumar, Geeta Trilok; Toteja, G.

Mushrooming of slums due to continuous urbanization has made diarrhoea one of the biggest public-health challenges in metropolitan cities in India. The objective of the study was to carry out a community-based health and nutrition-education intervention, focusing on several factors influencing child health with special emphasis on diarrhoea, in a slum of Delhi, India. Mothers (n=370) of children, aged >12-71 months, identified by a door-to-door survey from a large urban slum, were enrolled in the study in two groups, i.e. control and intervention. To ensure minimal group interaction, enrollment for the control and intervention groups was done purposively from two extreme ends of the slum cluster. Baseline assessment of knowledge, attitudes, and practices on diarrhoea-related issues, such as oral rehydration therapy (ORT), oral rehydration salt (ORS), and continuation of breastfeeding during diarrhoea, was carried out using a pretested questionnaire. Thereafter, mothers (n=195) from the intervention area were provided health and nutrition education through fortnightly contacts achieved by two approaches developed for the study-'personal discussion sessions' and 'lane approach'. The mothers (n=175) from the control area were not contacted. After the intervention, there was a significant (p=0.000) improvement in acquaintance to the term 'ORS' (65-98%), along with its method of reconstitution from packets (13-69%); preparation of home-made sugar-salt solution (10-74%); role of both in the prevention of dehydration (30-74%) and importance of their daily preparation (74-96%); and continuation of breastfeeding during diarrhoea (47-90%) in the intervention area. Sensitivity about age-specific feeding of ORS also improved significantly (p=0.000) from 13% to 88%. The reported usage of ORS packets and sugar-salt solution improved significantly from 12% to 65% (p=0.000) and 12% to 75% (p=0.005) respectively. The results showed that health and nutrition-education intervention improved the knowledge and attitudes of mothers. The results indica Le a need for intensive programmes, especially directed towards urban slums to further improve the usage of oral rehydration therapy.","cited":19,"publisher":"BMC","year":2010,"volume":"28","issue":"6","pages":7},{"authors":"Tabrizi, Jafar Sadegh; Farahbakhsh, Mostafa; Bazargani, Homayoun Sadeghi; Saadati, Mohammad; Golestani, Mina; Zakeri, Akram","title":"Health Services Utilization and Responsiveness: A comparison of Slum and Non-slum Regions in Tabriz, Iran","source":"MEDICAL SCIENCE","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"Background: Health services utilization and responsiveness is a variable that can be affected by the location of habitat. This must be considered in planning and employing a system of proper service delivery. The aim of this study was to compare health care utilization and responsiveness between Akhmaqaya Slum Region (ASR) and Tabriz Representative Sample (TSR), Iran. Methods: A cross-sectional household study, using cluster random sampling, (n= 582 households) was conducted in 2015. Akhmaqaya slum region and Tabriz city were selected for data collection. A validated questionnaire was used for data collection. Data were analyzed by STATA 13. Results: Household's socio-economic status was significantly high in Tabriz. Moreover 7.2% of Akhmaqaya slum households were not able to use health services especially medication in their last year due to the high costs when compared with 3.3% in Tabriz. Results showed that 18.5% of Akhmaqaya slum households and 6.4% of Tabriz households had no insurance coverage. Services quality was rated to be average and bad by 40% of households. Responsiveness level in both regions was low and significant difference was not observed between the two regions. Conclusion: it was concluded that socio-economic differences seem to contribute in the health services utilization inequities between Akhmaqaya slum region and Tabriz as a sample. As well as low insurance coverage and financial protection, led to more refuse in health services utilization in slum households. It sounds that health policy in Iran must concentrate more on redesigning health provision structures to eliminate inequities originated by the difference in regions of living.","funding":"Health Services Management Research Centre, Tabriz University of Medical Science, Tabriz, Iran","cited":36,"publisher":"DISCOVERY PUBLICATION","year":2018,"volume":"22","issue":"94","pages":6},{"authors":"Tumwebaze, Innocent K.; Mosler, Hans-Joachim","title":"Why clean the toilet if others don't?

In an urban slum the Government of Delhi built one-room houses for some of the residents in what is termed a 'plot area'. Not all residents could be accommodated in the project and the remainder continued to live next door in shanty houses of the slum. Nineteen years later, young children who had migrated with their parents, have grown up and have children of their own. We looked at the development of the children living in the two types of accommodation. Methods: A total of 373 children were studied. All children (n = 200) between the ages of 3.5 and 5.5 years in a cluster of five residential blocks in the plot area were studied. As a control, children in two large clusters of shanty houses (n = 173) were also studied. For development assessment the Central Institute of Education (CIE) Test was performed. This is an Indian adaptation of the Standford-Binet Test. Multiple regression analysis was utilized to determine the factors that influenced IQ most. Results: The mean IQ of the children in the plot area was 92.5 (s.d. 13.38) and in the shanty houses 89.5 (s.d. 12.9) (p = 0.05). Analysis showed that the most significant factors affecting IQ were malnutrition in the first 6 months of life and attendance of the child at pre-school. For nutrition in the first 6 months, there was no difference between the groups. For attendance at pre-school, 110 of 200 in the plot area and 47 of 173 in the shanty houses were attending pre-school (p < 0.01).

In the recent past, there has been a rise in the prevalence of mental illness and maladaptive behaviours among adolescents living in slum populations, which are increasing at an alarming rate in many developing countries, mainly due to rural-urban migration, are characterized by poverty, poor housing, overcrowding, poor environment, and high prevalence of communicable diseases. This neglected population has become a major reservoir for a broad spectrum of adverse health conditions. Studies on the mental health status among adolescents in India are relatively scarce. The main objective of the study was to estimate the prevalence of mental health disorder and its determinants among adolescents in slum settings in Lucknow, India; by using GHQ-12. The study used cross-sectional primary data which was collected in 2015-2016 from the adolescents living in various slums of Lucknow city. About 590 adolescents whose parents gave consent to participate were included in the study. Descriptive statistics, Chi square test and ordered logistic regression analysis (OLR) technique were used to assess the mental health. Reliability of GHQ-12 was assessed before performing the analysis which was found to be 0.79. Approximately, 33% of adolescents were found to suffer from severe level of mental disorder. The results of this study depicts that adolescents of age 12-15 years had more severe mental health problems compares to 16-19 years of adolescents.

This study made a qualitative and quantitative assessment of water-related needs of women living in slums across different regions of the city. Considering the rapid growth of slums, climatic changes and little change in the gendered distribution of domestic responsibilities, women are likely to spend huge amounts of time in meeting their practical gender needs of water and other resources.

It is therefore very important to enhance the overall adaptive capacity of urban poor women to face the challenges of rapid urbanisation and climate change.","funding":"Ministry of Environment and Forests, Government of IndiaMinistry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC), Government of India; UK AIDCGIAR; TERI; Institute of Development Studies; Stockholm Environment Institute","cited":42,"publisher":"SAGE PUBLICATIONS INDIA  PVT LTD","year":2015,"volume":"22","issue":"1","pages":26},{"authors":"Huey, Samantha Lee; Finkelstein, Julia Leigh; Venkatramanan, Sudha; Udipi, Shobha A.; Ghugre, Padmini; Thakker, Varsha; Thorat, Aparna; Potdar, Ramesh D.; Chopra, Harsha, V; Kurpad, Anura, V; Haas, Jere Douglas; Mehta, Saurabh","title":"Prevalence and Correlates of Undernutrition in Young Children Living in Urban Slums of Mumbai, India: A Cross Sectional Study","source":"FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"Background: Young children living in urban slums are vulnerable to malnutrition and subsequently poor health outcomes, but data on the correlates of stunting, underweight, wasting, and anemia specifically among 10-18 month-old children in India remain limited. Objective: In this analysis, we sought to describe the prevalence of and examine correlates for different markers of undernutrition, including stunting, underweight, and anemia among 10-18 month-old children living in urban slums, an understudied vulnerable group. Methods: Children and their mothers (n = 323) were screened for anthropometry, demographics, and complete blood counts for hemoglobin concentration between March and November 2017 (Clinicaltrials.gov ID: NCT02233764). Correlates included child and mother's age, sex, birth order, birth weight, illness episodes, hemoglobin concentration, family income, maternal height, and maternal education level. Risk ratios (RR, 95% CI) for binary outcomes (stunting, underweight, wasting and anemia) and mean differences (beta, 95% CI) for continuous outcomes (anthropometric Z-scores, hemoglobin concentration) were calculated using multivariate binomial and linear regression (SAS 9.4). Results: The prevalence of stunting was 31.2%, underweight 25.1%, wasting (9.0%), and anemia (76%) among all children. Male children had a higher prevalence of poor growth indices and lower anthropometric Z-scores than females. Male sex, low birthweight, shorter maternal height, report of >= 1 episodes of illness within the past month, older maternal age, and birth order >= 2 were also associated with poor growth and anemia in multivariate models. Correlates of undernutrition were different among females and males. Female children had a 40% (20, 60%) higher risk of anemia associated with diarrhea, and male children who were firstborn had a 20% (0, 70%) lower risk of anemia. Conclusions: These results show that poor growth and anemia among young children is prevalent in urban slums of Mumbai, and that sex of the child may play an important role in informing interventions to address undernutrition.","funding":"HarvestPlus [2014H8302]; Bill and Melinda Gates FoundationBill & Melinda Gates Foundation","cited":95,"publisher":"FRONTIERS MEDIA SA","year":2019,"volume":"7","pages":13},{"authors":"Lange, Maurice","title":"Multidimensional poverty in Kolkata's slums: towards data driven decision making in a medium-sized NGO","source":"JOURNAL OF POVERTY AND SOCIAL JUSTICE","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"Calcutta Rescue (CR) is a medium-sized NGO based in Kolkata, India that focuses on supporting the residents of the city's slums.

Access to child health services remains integral to improving child health outcomes. Cognisant that improvements in child health have been unevenly distributed, it is imperative that health services and research focus on the disadvantaged groups. Children residing in urban slums are known to face a health disadvantage that is masked by the common view of an urban health advantage. Granted increasing urbanisation rates and proliferation of urban slums resulting from urban poverty, the health of under-five children in slums remains a public health imperative in Malawi. We explored determinants of healthcare-seeking from a biomedical health provider for childhood symptoms of fever, cough with fast breathing and diarrhoea in three urban slums of Lilongwe, Malawi. Methods This was a population-based cross-sectional study involving 543 caregivers of under-five children. Data on childhood morbidity and healthcare seeking in three months period were collected using face-to-face interviews guided by a validated questionnaire. Data were entered in CS-Pro 5.0 and analysed in SPSS version 20 using descriptive statistics and logistic regression analyses. Results 61% of caregivers sought healthcare albeit 53% of them sought healthcare late. Public health facilities constituted the most frequently used health providers. Healthcare was more likely to be sought: for younger than older under-five children (AOR = 0.54; 95% CI: 0.30-0.99); when illness was perceived to be severe (AOR = 2.40; 95% CI: 1.34-4.30); when the presenting symptom was fever (AOR = 1.77; 95% CI: 1.10-2.86). Home management of childhood illness was negatively associated with care-seeking (AOR = 0.54; 95% CI: 0.36-0.81) and timely care-seeking (AOR = 0.44; 95% CI: 0.2-0.74). Caregivers with good knowledge of child danger signs were less likely to seek care timely (AOR = 0.57; 95% CI: 0.33-0.99). Conclusions Even in the context of geographical proximity to healthcare services, caregivers in urban slums may not seek healthcare or when they do so the majority may not undertake timely healthcare care seeking. Factors related to the child, the type of illness, and the caregiver are central to the healthcare decision making dynamics. Improving access to under-five child health services therefore requires considering multiple factors.","funding":"Connecting Health Research in Africa and Ireland Consortium (CHRAIC); Health Research Capacity Strengthening Initiative","cited":68,"publisher":"BMC","year":2020,"volume":"20","issue":"1","pages":13},{"authors":"Ayah, Richard; Joshi, Mark D.; Wanjiru, Rosemary; Njau, Elijah K.; Otieno, C.

Health strategies that focus on non-communicable diseases (NCD) in this segment of the population are generally lacking. We determined the prevalence of diabetes and associated cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors correlates in Kibera, Nairobi's largest slum. Methods: We conducted a population-based household survey utilising cluster sampling with probability proportional to size. Households were selected using a random walk method and consenting residents aged 18 years and above were recruited. The WHO STEPS instrument was administered. A random capillary blood sugar (RCBS) was obtained; known persons with diabetes and subjects with a RCBS >11.1 had an 8 hours fasting blood sugar (FBS) drawn. Diabetes was defined as a RCBS of >= 11.1 mmol/l and a FBS of >= 7.0 mmol/l, or a prior diagnosis or receiving diabetes drug treatment. Results: Out of 2061 enrolled; 50.9% were males, mean age was 33.4 years and 87% had a minimum of primary education. Only 10.6% had ever had a blood sugar measurement. Age adjusted prevalence of diabetes was 5.3% (95% CI 4.2-6.4) and prevalence increased with age peaking at 10.5% (95% CI 6.8-14.3%) in the 45-54 year age category. Diabetes mellitus (DM) correlates were: 13.1% smoking, 74.9% alcohol consumption, 75.7% high level of physical activity; 16.3% obese and 29% overweight with higher rates in women. Among persons with diabetes the odds of obesity, elevated waist circumference and hypertension were three, two and three fold respectively compared to those without diabetes. Cardiovascular risk factors among subjects with diabetes were high and mirrored that of the entire sample; however they had a significantly higher use of tobacco. Conclusions: This previously unstudied urban slum has a high prevalence of DM yet low screening rates. Key correlates include cigarette smoking and high alcohol consumption. However high levels of physical activity were also reported. Findings have important implications for NCD prevention and care.

Women living in slums, with unhealthy environment, both indoors and outdoors, particularly those living close to industrial and/or vehicular pollution zones due to multiple sources of air pollution, are at the higher risk of having impaired lung function tests. Objective: The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of abnormal lung functions and to identify the environmental risk factors associated with them among adult women of 18-59 years. Materials and Methods: A total of 550 women aged 18-59 years were approached in a representative urban slum. Five hundred consented to participate and 299 had prebronchodilator spirometry satisfying ATS standards. House visits to assess environmental conditions were conducted to determine their association with forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC). Chi-square test was used to test the association of risk factors with lung functions. ANOVA was used to test the association of mean values of FEV1 and FVC with age. Results: Out of 299 participants with acceptable spirometric curves, 5% had reduced FEV1/FVC ratio than the normal and 26.8% and 17.4% had lower values than predicted for FVC and FEV1, respectively. Altered lung function was related to age, tobacco smoking, and history of respiratory disease.

BRAC, a large Bangladeshi non-governmental organization (NGO), has employed female volunteer CHWs in its community-based health programs since 1977, recently including its Manoshi project, a community-based maternal and child health intervention in the urban slums of Bangladesh. A case-control study conducted in response to high dropout rates in the first year of the project showed that financial incentives, social prestige, community approval and household responsibilities were related to early retention in the project. In our present prospective cohort study, we aimed to better understand the factors associated with retention of volunteer CHWs once the project was more mature. Methods: We used a prospective cohort study design to examine the factors affecting retention of volunteer CHWs who remained in the project after the initial start-up period. We surveyed a random sample of 542 CHWs who were working for BRAC Manoshi in December 2008. In December 2009, we revisited this cohort of CHWs and interviewed those who had dropped out about the main reasons for their dropping out. We used a multivariable generalized linear model regression analysis with a log link to estimate the relative risk (RR) of independent factors on retention. Results: Of the 542 CHWs originally enrolled, 120 had dropped out by the end of one year, mainly because they left the slums. CHWs who received positive community appraisal (adjusted RR = 1.45, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.10 to 1.91) or were associated with other NGOs (adjusted RR = 1.13, 95% CI = 1.04 to 1.23) were more likely to have been retained in the project. Although refresher training was also associated with increased retention (adjusted RR = 2.25, 95% CI = 1.08 to 4.71) in this study, too few CHWs had not attended refresher training regularly to make it a meaningful predictor of retention that could be applied in the project setting. Conclusion: Factors that affect retention of CHWs may change over time, with some factors that are important in the early years of a project losing importance as the project matures. Community health programs operating in fragile urban slums should consider changing factors over program duration for better retention of volunteer CHWs.","cited":28,"publisher":"BIOMED CENTRAL LTD","year":2014,"volume":"12","pages":11},{"authors":"Ramachandran, S","title":"Operation pushback: Sangh Parivar, state, slums and surreptitious Bangladeshis in New Delhi","source":"SINGAPORE JOURNAL OF TROPICAL GEOGRAPHY","language":"English","doc":"Review","abstract":"The remarkable ease with which the xenophobic tenor of the Hindu Right nationalist organisations or Sangh Parivar found favour with many privileged Indians in the early 1990s cannot be easily or comfortably discounted.

By mid-1992, when Sangh Parivar made the manifold dangers of the unsanctioned immigration by growing numbers of poverty-stricken Bangladeshi Muslim peasants their rallying cry, the lenient attitude of the Indian state towards these immigrants had hardened with astonishing rapidity. Unsettled by this sweeping tide of Hindu chauvinism, a hurriedly enforced Action Plan to locate and identify these undocumented immigrants was followed by brisk efforts under Operation Pushback to deport them from New Delhi-India's capital city and locus of bureaucratic, political and financial power. Haphazard and sporadic in implementation, Operation Pushback, while unmasking partisan dispositions coursing through the Indian bureaucracy, also exemplified Congress' belated attempts at redeeming its enervated standing. It is also worth noting that the highly circumscribed material realities of the Bangladeshi immigrants residing in Delhi's numerous slums made them easy targets of these perverse politics, and that subsequent opposition, internally and from neighbouring Bangladesh, to the gratuitous brutality displayed towards the first groups of deportees contributed to the Operation's abrupt truncation.","cited":134,"publisher":"BLACKWELL PUBL LTD","year":2002,"volume":"23","issue":"3","pages":22},{"authors":"Kamndaya, Mphatso; Kazembe, Lawrence N.; Vearey, Jo; Kabiru, Caroline W.; Thomas, Liz","title":"Material deprivation and unemployment affect coercive sex among young people in the urban slums of Blantyre, Malawi: A multi-level approach","source":"HEALTH & PLACE","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"We explore relations among material deprivation (measured by insufficient housing, food insecurity and poor healthcare access), socio-economic status (employment, income and education) and coercive sex.

Diagnostic terminology is rarely used, may be stigmatizing, and is subject to misinterpretation. Local terms, such as idioms of distress, can improve mental health literacy and service delivery. Our objective was to examine lived experience and coping connected to distress and depression in an under-researched population: young men from LMIC urban slums. We conducted 60 qualitative interviews with men (ages 18-29) in Bhashantek slum, Bangladesh. Themes were generated using thematic analysis and grounded theory techniques. The heart-mind (mon), mentality (manoshikota), mood (mejaj), head (matha or brain), and body (shorir) comprised the self-concept, and were related to sadness, hopelessness, anger, worry, and mental illness. The English word tension was the central idiom of distress. Tension existed on a continuum, from mild distress or motivational anxiety, to moderate distress including rumination and somatic complaints, to severe psychopathology including anhedonia and suicidality. Respondents connected tension to burnout experiences and mental illness which was summarized in an ethnopsychological model. These findings can inform culturally sensitive measurement tools and interventions that are acceptable to the community, potentially increasing engagement and enhancing therapeutic outcomes.","funding":"Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) [W 08,560.007]; George Washington University","cited":71,"publisher":"SPRINGER","pages":33},{"authors":"Srivastava, A.

We conducted a focused ethnographic study of illness in young infants and associated careseeking practices in an; urban slum in New Delhi, India, in order to identify the constraints in securing effective care for severe illness in this age group. The findings suggest that maternal recognition of illness is not a limiting factor in the use of health care services for sick young infants in this setting. Mothers respond to a number of important signs of illness, including changes in-the young infant's sleeping or feeding behavior, and they are usually prompt in seeking care outside the home. They are not able, however, to discriminate among the many sources of health care available in this setting, and give preference to local unqualified private practitioners. Most practitioners, including qualified medical practitioners, display critical failures in the assessment and management of sick young infants. The continuity and effectiveness of care is further compromised by the caretakers' expectations of rapid cure, which result in discontinued treatment courses and frequent changes in practitioners, and by their reluctance to seek hospital care. The implications of these findings for the design of programs to reduce young infant mortality are discussed.

TB/HIV co-infection rate was 16.9%; 57.4% received antiretroviral therapy (ART) and 88.3% received cotrimoxazole preventive therapy (CPT). Female patients were significantly younger compared to male patients (p = 0.003), had higher proportions of smear-negative TB (p = 0.001) and HIV-positive status (p <= 0.001). Treatment success rate was 88.5% among smear-positive patients and 79.3% among smear-negative patients. More patients with smear-negative TB were lost to follow up compared with smear-positive TB patients (p < 0.02). HIV co-infection was associated with unfavourable treatment outcomes (OR 0.2, CI 0.1-0.4, p <= 0.001). Among them, those who received ART had better outcomes. Conclusions: The study revealed high proportion of PTB, mostly smear-positive TB with HIV-associated outcomes and underlines the need to ensure early TB diagnosis and improved access to HIV care for HIV co-infected patients in this setting.

Yet, few studies have examined youth's perceptions of the economic drivers of HIV. Informed by traditional and behavioral economics, we applied a scarcity theoretical framework to qualitatively examine how poverty influences sexual risk behaviors among adolescents and young adults. Focus group discussions with one hundred twenty youth in Kenyan's urban slums were transcribed, coded, and analyzed using interpretive phenomenology. Results indicated that slum youth made many sexual decisions considered rational from a traditional economics perspective, such as acquiring more sex when resources were available, maximizing wealth through sex, being price-sensitive to costs of condoms or testing services, and taking more risks when protected from adverse sexual consequences. Youth's engagement in sexual risk behaviors was also motivated by scarcity phenomena explained by behavioral economics, such as compensating for sex lost during scarce periods (risk-seeking), valuing economic gains over HIV risks (tunneling, bandwidth tax), and transacting sex as an investment strategy (internal referencing). When scarcity was alleviated, young women additionally described reducing the number of sex partners to account for non-economic preferences (slack). Prevention strategies should address the traditional and behavioral economics of the HIV epidemic.","funding":"Johns Hopkins University (JHU) Center for AIDS Research (CFAR), an NIH - NIAID [P30AI094189]; Johns Hopkins University (JHU) Center for AIDS Research (CFAR), an NIH - NCI [P30AI094189]; Johns Hopkins University (JHU) Center for AIDS Research (CFAR), an NIH - NICHD [P30AI094189]; Johns Hopkins University (JHU) Center for AIDS Research (CFAR), an NIH - NHLBI [P30AI094189]; Johns Hopkins University (JHU) Center for AIDS Research (CFAR), an NIH - NIDA [P30AI094189]; Johns Hopkins University (JHU) Center for AIDS Research (CFAR), an NIH - NIMH [P30AI094189]; Johns Hopkins University (JHU) Center for AIDS Research (CFAR), an NIH - NIA [P30AI094189]; Johns Hopkins University (JHU) Center for AIDS Research (CFAR), an NIH - FIC [P30AI094189]; Johns Hopkins University (JHU) Center for AIDS Research (CFAR), an NIH - NIGMS [P30AI094189]; Johns Hopkins University (JHU) Center for AIDS Research (CFAR), an NIH - NIDDK [P30AI094189]; Johns Hopkins University (JHU) Center for AIDS Research (CFAR), an NIH - OAR [P30AI094189]; National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [K01MH107310]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [P30AI094189] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [K01MH107310] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","cited":84,"publisher":"SPRINGER/PLENUM PUBLISHERS","year":2017,"volume":"21","issue":"9","pages":15},{"authors":"Yazdani, Amna Tanweer; Muhammad, Ameer; Nisar, Muhammad Imran; Khan, Uzma; Shafiq, Yasir","title":"Unveiling and addressing implementation barriers to routine immunization in the peri-urban slums of Karachi, Pakistan: a mixed-methods study","source":"HEALTH RESEARCH POLICY AND SYSTEMS","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"Background Great disparities in immunization coverage exist in Pakistan between urban and rural areas. However, coverage estimates for large peri-urban slums in Sindh are largely unknown and implementation challenges remain unexplored. This study explores key supply- and demand-side immunization barriers in peri-urban slums, as well as strategies to address them. It also assesses immunization coverage in the target slums. Methods Conducted in four peri-urban slums in Karachi, this mixed-methods study consists of a baseline cross-sectional coverage survey of a representative sample of 840 caregivers of children aged 12-23 months, and 155 in-depth interviews (IDIs) through purposive sampling of respondents (caregivers, community influencers and immunization staff). After identifying the barriers, a further six IDIs were then conducted with immunization policy-makers and policy influencers to determine strategies to address these barriers, resulting in the development of an original validated implementation framework for immunization in peri-urban slums. A thematic analysis approach was applied to qualitative data. Results The survey revealed 49% of children were fully vaccinated, 43% were partially vaccinated and 8% were unvaccinated. Demand-side immunization barriers included household barriers, lack of knowledge and awareness, misconceptions and fears regarding vaccines and social and religious barriers. Supply-side barriers included underperformance of staff, inefficient utilization of funds, unreliable immunization and household data and interference of polio campaigns with immunization. The implementation framework's policy recommendations to address these barriers include: (1) improved human resource management; (2) staff training on counselling; (3) re-allocation of funds towards incentives, outreach, salaries and infrastructure; (4) a digital platform integrating birth registry and vaccination tracking systems for monitoring and reporting by frontline staff; (5) use of digital platform for immunization targets and generating dose reminders; and (6) mutual sharing of resources and data between the immunization, Lady Health Worker and polio programmes for improved coverage. Conclusions The implementation framework is underpinned by the study of uncharted immunization barriers in complex peri-urban slums, and can be used by implementers in Pakistan and other developing countries to improve immunization programmes in limited-resource settings, with possible application at a larger scale. In particular, a digital platform integrating vaccination tracking and birth registry data can be expanded for nationwide use.","funding":"Alliance for Health Policy and Systems Research; UNICEF; Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance; VITAL Pakistan Trust","cited":25,"publisher":"BMC","year":2021,"volume":"19","issue":"SUPPL 2","pages":9},{"authors":"Chakraborty, Raja; Bose, Kaushik; Koziel, Slawomir","title":"Waist circumference in determining obesity and hypertension among 18-60 years old Bengalee Hindu male slum dwellers in Eastern India","source":"ANNALS OF HUMAN BIOLOGY","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"Background: Waist circumference (WC) has been previously shown to be the most efficient measure to explain variability in body mass index (BMI) and percentage body fat (PBF) in Bengalee males, including those under study. Aim: The objective was to evaluate the relative usefulness of WC and its single suitable value, if any, to identify both generalized obesity and hypertension in Bengalee men. Subjects and methods: This cross-sectional study included 433 adult (18-60 years) Bengalee Hindu slum dwelling men. Height, weight, waist circumference, systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressures were measured. BMI was computed as weight (in kg) divided by height (in metres) squared. Hypertension (HT) was defined as SBP >= 140 mmHg and/or DBP >= 90 mmHg. A BMI >= 23 kg/m(2) and >= 25 kg/m(2) were considered overweight and obesity, respectively. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses were employed to determine the best cut-off points to define HT and overweight. Results: Prevalence of HT, overweight and obesity were 17.6% and 20.1% and 8.3%, respectively. Prevalence of central obesity using the cut-offs of 102 cm, 90 cm and 80 cm were 0.46%, 5.08% and 24.7%, respectively. Both in obese and non-obese, WC >= 80 cm was significantly associated with higher SBP and DBP than WC < 80 cm. WC > 79.4 cm and >80.3 cm were the most appropriate for detecting HT and overweight status. Conclusion: WC value of similar to 80 cm could efficiently discriminate both obesity and hypertension among the Bengalee Hindu slum dwelling men aged between 18-60 years. Central obesity, determined by WC >= 80 cm, was associated with increased blood pressure and higher risk of HT, independent of age and general obesity.","funding":"University Grants Commission (India)University Grants Commission, India [PSW-054/03-04 ERO]","cited":46,"publisher":"INFORMA HEALTHCARE","year":2011,"volume":"38","issue":"6","pages":7},{"authors":"Subbaraman, Ramnath; Shitole, Shrutika; Shitole, Tejal; Sawant, Kiran; O'Brien, Jennifer; Bloom, David E.; Patil-Deshmukh, Anita","title":"The social ecology of water in a Mumbai slum: failures in water quality, quantity, and reliability","source":"BMC PUBLIC HEALTH","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"Background: Urban slums in developing countries that are not recognized by the government often lack legal access to municipal water supplies. This results in the creation of insecure informal water distribution systems (i.e., community-run or private systems outside of the government's purview) that may increase water-borne disease risk. We evaluate an informal water distribution system in a slum in Mumbai, India using commonly accepted health and social equity indicators. We also identify predictors of bacterial contamination of drinking water using logistic regression analysis. Methods: Data were collected through two studies: the 2008 Baseline Needs Assessment survey of 959 households and the 2011 Seasonal Water Assessment, in which 229 samples were collected for water quality testing over three seasons. Water samples were collected in each season from the following points along the distribution system: motors that directly tap the municipal supply (i.e., point-of-source water), hoses going to slum lanes, and storage and drinking water containers from 21 households. Results: Depending on season, households spend an average of 52 to 206 times more than the standard municipal charge of Indian rupees 2.25 (US dollars 0.04) per 1000 liters for water, and, in some seasons, 95% use less than the WHO-recommended minimum of 50 liters per capita per day. During the monsoon season, 50% of point-of-source water samples were contaminated. Despite a lack of point-of-source water contamination in other seasons, stored drinking water was contaminated in all seasons, with rates as high as 43% for E. coli and 76% for coliform bacteria. In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, monsoon and summer seasons were associated with significantly increased odds of drinking water contamination. Conclusions: Our findings reveal severe deficiencies in water-related health and social equity indicators. All bacterial contamination of drinking water occurred due to post-source contamination during storage in the household, except during the monsoon season, when there was some point-of-source water contamination. This suggests that safe storage and household water treatment interventions may improve water quality in slums. Problems of exorbitant expense, inadequate quantity, and poor point-of-source quality can only be remedied by providing unrecognized slums with equitable access to municipal water supplies.","funding":"Ford Foundation, New York, NY, U.S.A; Rockefeller Foundation, New York, NY, U.S.A; National Institutes of Health Office of the DirectorUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; Fogarty International CenterUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Fogarty International Center (FIC); Office of AIDS ResearchUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; National Cancer Center; National Eye InstituteUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI); National Heart, Blood, and Lung InstituteUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Heart Lung & Blood Institute (NHLBI); National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial ResearchUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Dental & Craniofacial Research (NIDCR); National Institute On Drug AbuseUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)European Commission; National Institute of Mental HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH); National Institute of Allergy and Infectious DiseasesUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID); National Institutes of Health Office of Women's Health and Research through the Fogarty International Clinical Research Scholars; Fellows Program at Vanderbilt University [R24 TW007988]; American Relief and Recovery Act; FOGARTY INTERNATIONAL CENTERUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Fogarty International Center (FIC) [R24TW007988] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","cited":33,"publisher":"BMC","year":2013,"volume":"13","pages":14},{"authors":"Kyobutungi, Catherine; Egondi, Thaddaeus; Ezeh, Alex","title":"The health and well-being of older people in Nairobi's slums","source":"GLOBAL HEALTH ACTION","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"Background: Globally, it is estimated that people aged 60 and over constitute more than 11% of the population, with the corresponding proportion in developing countries being 8%. Rapid urbanisation in subSaharan Africa (SSA), fuelled in part by rural-urban migration and a devastating HIV/AIDS epidemic, has altered the status of older people in many SSA societies. Few studies have, however, looked at the health of older people in SSA. This study aims to describe the health and well-being of older people in two Nairobi slums. Methods: Data were collected from residents of the areas covered by the Nairobi Urban Health and Demographic Surveillance System (NUHDSS) aged 50 years and over by 1 October 2006. Health status was assessed using the short SAGE (Study on Global AGEing and Adult Health) form. Mean WHO Quality of Life (WHOQoL) and a composite health score were computed and binary variables generated using the median as the cut-off. Logistic regression was used to determine factors associated with poor quality of life (QoL) and poor health status. Results: Out of 2,696 older people resident in the NUHDSS surveillance area during the study period, data were collected on 2,072. The majority of respondents were male, aged 50-60 years. The mean WHOQoL score was 71.3 (SD 6.7) and mean composite health score was 70.6 (SD 13.9). Males had significantly better QoL and health status than females and older respondents had worse outcomes than younger ones. Sex, age, education level and marital status were significantly associated with QoL, while slum of residence was significantly associated with health status. Conclusion: The study adds to the literature on health and well-being of older people in SSA, especially those in urban informal settlements. Further studies are needed to validate the methods used for assessing health status and to provide comparisons from other settings. Health and Demographic Surveillance Systems have the potential to conduct such studies and to evaluate health and well-being over time.","funding":"Wellcome Trust UKWellcome Trust [GR078530AIA]; William and Flora Hewlett Foundation; Rockefeller Foundation; National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA","cited":29,"publisher":"TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","year":2010,"volume":"3","pages":9},{"authors":"Ganle, John Kuumuori; Baatiema, Leonard; Ayamah, Paul; Ofori, Charlotte Abra Esime; Ameyaw, Edward Kwabena; Seidu, Abdul-Aziz; Ankomah, Augustine","title":"Family planning for urban slums in low- and middle-income countries: a scoping review of interventions/service delivery models and their impact","source":"INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR EQUITY IN HEALTH","language":"English","doc":"Review","abstract":"Background Although evidence suggest that many slum dwellers in low- and middle-income countries have the most difficulty accessing family planning (FP) services, there are limited workable interventions/models for reaching slum communities with FP services. This review aimed to identify existing interventions and service delivery models for providing FP services in slums, and as well examine potential impact of such interventions and service delivery models in low- and middle-income settings. Methods We searched and retrieved relevant published studies on the topic from 2000 to 2020 from e-journals, health sources and six electronic databases (MEDLINE, Global Health, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO and Web of Science). Grey and relevant unpublished literature (e.g., technical reports) were also included. For inclusion, studies should have been published in a low- and middle-income country between 2000 and 2020. All study designs were included. Review articles, protocols or opinion pieces were excluded. Search results were screened for eligible articles and reports using a pre-defined criterion. Descriptive statistics and narrative syntheses were produced to summarize and report findings. Results The search of the e-journals, health sources and six electronic databases including grey literature and other unpublished materials produced 1,260 results. Following screening for title relevance, abstract and full text, nine eligible studies/reports remained. Six different types of FP service delivery models were identified: voucher schemes; married adolescent girls' club interventions; Willows home-based counselling and referral programme; static clinic and satellite clinics; franchised family planning clinics; and urban reproductive health initiatives. The urban reproductive health initiatives were the most dominant FP service delivery model targeting urban slums. As regards the impact of the service delivery models identified, the review showed that the identified interventions led to improved targeting of poor urban populations, improved efficiency in delivery of family planning service, high uptake or utilization of services, and improved quality of family planning services. Conclusions This review provides important insights into existing family planning service delivery models and their potential impact in improving access to FP services in poor urban slums. Further studies exploring the quality of care and associated sexual and reproductive health outcomes as a result of the uptake of these service delivery models are essential. Given that the studies were reported from only 9 countries, further studies are needed to advance knowledge on this topic in other low-middle income countries where slum populations continue to rise.","funding":"Bill & Melinda Gates FoundationBill & Melinda Gates FoundationCGIAR [INV-008737]","cited":39,"publisher":"BMC","year":2021,"volume":"20","issue":"1","pages":15},{"authors":"Brelsford, Christa; Martin, Taylor; Hand, Joe; Bettencourt, Luis M.

We show that it is possible to diagnose systematically the central physical problem of slums-the lack of spatial accesses and related services-using a topological analysis of neighborhood maps and resolved by finding solutions to a sequence of constrained optimization problems. We set up the problem by showing that the built environment of any city can be decomposed into two types of networked spaces-accesses and places-and prove that these spaces display universal topological characteristics. We then show that while the neighborhoods of developed cities express the same common topology, urban slums fall into a different topological class. We demonstrate that it is always possible to find solutions that grow a street network in existing slums, providing universal accesses at minimal disruption and cost. We then show how elaborations of this procedure that include local preferences and reduce travel distances between places result from additional access construction. These methods are presently taking effect in neighborhoods in Cape Town (South Africa) and Mumbai (India), demonstrating their practical feasibility and emphasizing their role as a platform to enable communities and local governments to combine technical knowledge with local aspirations into contextually appropriate urban sustainable development solutions.","funding":"Arizona State University/Santa Fe Institute Center for Biosocial Complex Systems; Bill & Melinda Gates FoundationBill & Melinda Gates Foundation [OPP1076282]; MacArthur Foundation [13-105749-000-USP]; Army Research Office Minerva program [W911NF1210097]; Laboratory Directed Research and Development Program of Oak Ridge National Laboratory","cited":39,"publisher":"AMER ASSOC ADVANCEMENT SCIENCE","year":2018,"volume":"4","issue":"8","pages":8},{"authors":"Roy, AN; Jockin, A; Javed, A","title":"Community police stations in Mumbai's slums","source":"ENVIRONMENT AND URBANIZATION","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"This paper describes how an alliance between slum dwellers' federations and the police has set tip community police stations in the slums of Mumbai and Pune, and explains how these operate.","cited":1,"publisher":"SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD","year":2004,"volume":"16","issue":"2","pages":4},{"authors":"Jeyakumar, Angeline; Ghugre, Padmini","title":"Assessment of personal hygiene and sanitation using a composite index among adolescent girls and their households in urban slums of Pune, Maharashtra","source":"JOURNAL OF WATER SANITATION AND HYGIENE FOR DEVELOPMENT","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"The assessment of hygiene and sanitation in urban slums is essential to identify adolescent health needs.

We examined the association between slum residence and nutritional status in women in India by using competing classifications of slum type. Methods. We used nationally representative data from the 2005-2006 National Family Health Survey (NFHS-3) to create our citywide analysis sample. The data provided us with individual, household, and community information. We used the body mass index data to identify nutritional status, whereas the residential status variable provided slum details. We used a multinomial regression framework to model the 3 nutrition states-undernutrition, normal, and overnutrition. Results. After we controlled for a range of attributes, we found that living in a census slum did not affect nutritional status. By contrast, living in NFHS slums decreased the odds of being overweight by 14% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.79, 0.95) and increased the odds of being underweight by 10% (95% CI = 1.00, 1.22). Conclusions. The association between slum residence and nutritional outcomes is nuanced and depends on how one defines a slum. This suggests that interventions targeted at slums should look beyond official definitions and include current living conditions to effectively reach the most vulnerable.

For typical conditions in sub-Saharan Africa, the nutrient loading of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) from on-site sanitation systems to aquifers is largely unknown. In this study, we assessed the dissolved nutrient loads (nitrate (NO3), ammonium (NH4) and orthophosphate (o-PO4)) and the processes likely affecting them in aquifers underlying two on-site sanitation systems in an unsewered low-income urban slum in Kampala, Uganda; a domestic solid waste dump and a site with two pit latrines. The impact of the two types of sites was assessed by comparing the upgradient and downgradient nutrient concentrations and loads along groundwater flow lines. Significant pollution to groundwater originated from the pit latrine site with downgradient nutrient loads increasing by factors of 1.7 for NO3, 10.5 for NH4 and 49 for o-PO4. No effect of leaching of nutrients to groundwater was found from the waste dump. We estimated that approximately 2-20% of total N and less than 1% of total P mass input was lost to groundwater from the pit latrines. The bulk of N leached to groundwater was in the form of NH4. Mn-reducing conditions prevailed in the shallow aquifer which suggested that nitrification was the main process affecting NH4 concentrations. Phosphorus was likely retained in the soils by precipitating as MnHPO4 and Cas(PO4)(3)(OH). Our results indicated that pit latrines in alluvial aquifer systems can be highly effective for the removal of nutrients depending on hydrological, hydrochemical and geochemical conditions in the aquifer receiving wastewater. Improvements to make the current pit latrine systems better for nutrient containment are suggested based on findings from this study. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Three bases of gender socialisation were identified: (1) verbal messaging (mainly from parents and teachers); (2) observing the behaviours of older men in the community; and (3) information received from mainstream and social media. Masculinity conceptualisations focussed on financial stability, family life and responsibility, physical attributes, character and religion. Two contrasting portrayals of masculinity emerged in the form of idealised and dominant masculinities. A close linkage was found between masculinity conceptualisations and sexual development.

However, engaging couples to understand how their gender attitudes affect their personal and family health is an idea in search of practice.

For each couple, surveys and semi-structured interviews were conducted with husbands and wives individually to contrast self and spousal work, time, interest in health, sources of information related to health and depth of knowledge (n = 62). Urban poverty forces men to work long hours and women to enter part-time work in the informal sector. Paid work induces lack of availability at home, lack of interest in health information and in performing household chores and a self-perception of being healthy among men. These factors inhibit men's' participation in community-based health promotion activities. Women's unpaid work in the household remains unnoticed. Women were expected to be interested in and to make time to attend community-based health-related activities. Men recalled significantly less sources of health information than their spouse. Men and their wives showed similar depth of health-related knowledge, likely due to their spousal communication, with women acting as gatekeepers. Health promotion planners must recognize time constraints, reliance on informal interpersonal communication as a source of health information and the need to portray positive masculinities that address asymmetric gender relations. Innovative, continuous and collaborative approaches may support couples to proactively care about health in low-resource settings.","cited":53,"publisher":"OXFORD UNIV PRESS","year":2020,"volume":"35","issue":"1","pages":12},{"authors":"Asiki, Gershim; Mohamed, Shukri F.; Wambui, David; Wainana, Caroline; Muthuri, Stella; Ramsay, Michele; Kyobutungi, Catherine","title":"Sociodemographic and behavioural factors associated with body mass index among men and women in Nairobi slums: AWI-Gen Project","source":"GLOBAL HEALTH ACTION","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"Background: Body mass index (BMI) is rising globally with a faster increase in urban areas in low- and middle-income countries. It is critical to identify modifiable risk factors for BMI to prevent the occurrence of associated health consequences. Objective: To investigate socio-demographic, behavioural and biological factors associated with BMI in Nairobi slums. Methods: In 2014-2015, a cross sectional study of men and women aged 40-60 years in Nairobi slums (Korogocho and Viwandani) was conducted. Data were collected on sociodemographic, behavioural and biological characteristics. Mean BMI, overweight and obesity were computed. Hierarchical multiple linear regression analysis was conducted separately for men and women to explore factors associated with BMI. Results: In total, 1942 study participants (54.4%, women) with a mean age (SD) of 48.3 (53) years and 48.8(5.6) years for women and men respectively were recruited. Mean BMI was higher among women than men (27.6 versus 22.8; p < 0.001). More women were overweight (30.9% versus 19.6%; p < 0.001) and obese (32.1% versus 5.1%; p < 0.001) than men. Among men, BMI was independently associated with wealth index, bread consumption and self-reported diabetes and was negatively associated with current tobacco smoking, HIV and TB infections. Among women, BMI was independently associated with wealth, current nonproblematic drinking, and sedentary time, but was lower among other ethnicities compared to Kikuyu, among current smokers, women with longer sleep, and those with HIV infection and tuberculosis. Wealth index contributed the most variance in BMI among women and men (10.4%, 7.5%, respectively), but behavioural factors (7.4%) among men and biological factors (6.5%) among women accounted for most of the additional BMI variance. Conclusions: Adults aged 40-60 years in the urban slums of Nairobi have a high BMI associated with wealth. Bread consumption by men and sedentary life among women are the main risky behaviours that need urgent targeted interventions.","funding":"National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI)United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI); Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD); Office of the Director (OD) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) of the USA, H3Africa Consortium [U54HG006938]; NATIONAL HUMAN GENOME RESEARCH INSTITUTEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) [U54HG006938] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","cited":40,"publisher":"TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","year":2018,"volume":"11","pages":12},{"authors":"George, Carolin Elizabeth; Inbaraj, Leeberk Raja; Chandrasingh, Sindhulina; de Witte, L.

Fear and stigma related to infection, mistrust between officials and the population, the often-asymptomatic nature of the disease is likely to lead to under-reporting. We conducted a cross-sectional study to determine the seroprevalence of COVID-19 infection in a large slum in South India 3 months after the index case and recruited 499 adults (age >18 years). The majority (74.3%) were females and about one-third of the population reported comorbidities. The overall seroprevalence of IgG antibody for COVID-19 was 57.9% (95% CI 53.4-62.3). Age, education, occupation and the presence of reported comorbidities were not associated with seroprevalence (P-value >0.05). Case-to-undetected-infections ratio was 1:195 and infection fatality rate was calculated as 2.94 per 10 000 infections. We estimated seroprevalence of COVID-19 was very high in our study population. The focus in this slum should shift from infection prevention to managing the indirect consequences of the pandemic. We recommend seroprevalence studies in such settings before vaccination to identify the vulnerability of COVID-19 infection to optimise the use of insufficient resources. It is a wake-up call to societies and nations, to dedicate paramount attention to slums into recovery and beyond - to build, restore and maintain health equity for the 'Health and wellbeing of all'.","funding":"Azim Premji Foundation, Bangalore, India","cited":21,"publisher":"CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS","year":2021,"volume":"149","pages":6},{"authors":"Faye, Ousmane; Baschieri, Angela; Falkingham, Jane; Muindi, Kanyiva","title":"Hunger and Food Insecurity in Nairobi's Slums: An Assessment Using IRT Models","source":"JOURNAL OF URBAN HEALTH-BULLETIN OF THE NEW YORK ACADEMY OF MEDICINE","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"Although linked to poverty as conditions reflecting inadequate access to resources to obtain food, issues such as hunger and food insecurity have seldom been recognized as important in urban settings. Overall, little is known about the prevalence and magnitude of hunger and food insecurity in most cities. Yet, in sub-Saharan Africa where the majority of urban dwellers live on less than one dollar a day, it is obvious that a large proportion of the urban population must be satisfied with just one meal a day. This paper suggests using the one- and two-parameter item response theory models to infer a reliable and valid measure of hunger and food insecurity relevant to low-income urban settings, drawing evidence from the Nairobi Urban Health and Demographic Surveillance System. The reliability and accuracy of the items are tested using both the Mokken scale analysis and the Cronbach test. The validity of the inferred household food insecurity measure is assessed by examining how it is associated with households' economic status. Results show that food insecurity is pervasive amongst slum dwellers in Nairobi. Only one household in five is food-secure, and nearly half of all households are categorized as food-insecure with both adult and child hunger. Moreover, in line with what is known about household allocation of resources, evidence indicates that parents often forego food in order to prioritize their children.","funding":"Wellcome TrustWellcome TrustEuropean Commission [GR 07830M]; William and Flora Hewlett Foundation [2006-8376]; Rockefeller Foundation [2008 AR 001]; ESRCUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC) [ES/G027153/1] Funding Source: UKRI","cited":34,"publisher":"SPRINGER","year":2011,"volume":"88","pages":21},{"authors":"Nuwasiima, Afra; Nuwamanya, Elly; Babigumira, Janet U.; Nalwanga, Robinah; Asiimwe, Francis T.; Babigumira, Joseph B.","title":"Acceptability and utilization of family planning benefits cards by youth in slums in Kampala, Uganda","source":"CONTRACEPTION AND REPRODUCTIVE MEDICINE","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"Background This study was conducted to test the acceptability and utilization of family planning benefits cards (FPBCs) as incentives to increase family planning uptake among youth living in urban slums in Uganda.

We performed descriptive analyses and analyses of the association between different variables using binary logistic regression. Results The acceptability study included 280 eligible females. The majority were married (52%), Christian (87%), and aged 20 and above (84%). Acceptability of the program was high (93%). Seventy-two percent of females used the card at least once to access reproductive health services. Twenty-seven percent of female users discontinued family planning and 14% changed family planning methods during the study. Female users of short-term contraceptive methods were 11 times more likely to discontinue use of FPBCs compared to those who used long-term methods (adjusted OR = 10.9, P = 0.011). Participants in professional/managerial employment were 30 times more likely to discontinue compared to the unemployed (adjusted OR = 30.3, P = 0.015).

Bangladesh as a whole and slums in the megacity of Dhaka in particular are severely affected by the FSW. Data were collected from 3,207 subjects (aged 10+ years) through baseline surveys conducted in March 2008 and 2009. Twelve big slums in Dhaka and three adjacent villages were selected as study areas. Face-to-face interviews using a multidimensional pre-tested questionnaire were conducted by the trained university graduates. We performed various types of analyses ranging from the simple frequency analysis to the multivariable-adjusted logistic regression modelling. Our empirical findings suggest that slums were more affected by the FSW as compared to the rural areas. People living in the FSW-affected areas were more vulnerable in terms of individual-, household- and area-level characteristics than non-affected people. Age was also significantly associated with various health outcomes. According to multivariable analyses controlled for various factors, the FSW-affected people reported significantly higher likelihoods of health symptoms (namely fever, cold/cough, weakness), communicable diseases (namely diarrhoea and gastric disease) and poor mental well-being as compared to the non-affected people. Only the burden of non-communicable diseases was lower in the FSW-affected areas than the non-affected areas. Our findings lead us to conclude that the FSW-affected area is an independent risk factor for various physical and mental health problems. Urban slums are more affected than rural areas by the FSW. Therefore, we underscore the necessities of well-designed and comprehensive public health interventions focusing on individual, community and higher levels of interventions to reduce the FSW-related health and other consequences among the people living in the FSW-affected areas and urban slums in the rapidly growing city of Dhaka, Bangladesh.","funding":"German Research FoundationGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [KR 947/9-1,2,3, HO 2568/5-1,2,3]","cited":57,"publisher":"SPRINGER","year":2014,"volume":"70","issue":"1","pages":17},{"authors":"Powwattana, Arpaporn","title":"Sexual Behavior Model Among Young Thai Women Living in Slums in Bangkok, Thailand","source":"ASIA-PACIFIC JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"There has been a dramatic drop in age at first intercourse and concurrent rise in HIV infections among young Thai women living in slums.

Given the high relevance of social settings, this paper intends to explore how gender elements interact with health-seeking practices among men and women residing in an Indian urban slum, in consideration of the unique socio-cultural context that characterises India's slums. Methods: The study was conducted in Sahid Smriti Colony, a peri-urban slum of Kolkata, India. The referral technique was used for selecting participants, as people in the study area were not very comfortable in discussing their health issues and health-seeking behaviours. The final sample included 66 participants, 34 men and 32 women. Data was collected through individual face-to-face in-depth interviews with a semi-structured questionnaire. Results: The data analysis shows six categories of reasons underlying women's preferences for informal healers, which are presented in the form of the following themes: cultural competency of care, easy communication, gender-induced affordability, avoidance of social stigma and labelling, living with the burden of cultural expectations and geographical and cognitive distance of formal health care. In case of men ease of access, quality of treatment and expected outcome of therapies are the three themes that emerged as the reasons behind their preferences for formal care. Conclusion: Our results suggest that both men and women utilise formal and informal care, but with different motives and expectations, leading to contrasting health-seeking outcomes. These gender-induced contrasts relate to a preference for socio-cultural (women) versus technological (men) therapies and long (women) versus fast (men) treatment, and are linked to their different societal and familial roles. The role of women in following and maintaining socio-cultural norms leads them to focus on care that involves long discussions mixed with socio-cultural traits that help avoid economic and social sanctions, while the role of men as bread earners requires them to look for care that ensures a fast and complete recovery so as to avoid financial pressures.","cited":64,"publisher":"BMC","year":2018,"volume":"17","pages":14},{"authors":"Costa, Federico; Richardson, Jonathan L.; Dion, Kirstin; Mariani, Carol; Pertile, Arsinoe C.; Burak, Mary K.; Childs, James E.; Ko, Albert I.; Caccone, Adalgisa","title":"Multiple Paternity in the Norway Rat, Rattus norvegicus, from Urban Slums in Salvador, Brazil","source":"JOURNAL OF HEREDITY","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"The Norway rat, Rattus norvegicus, is one of the most important pest species globally and the main reservoir of leptospires causing human leptospirosis in the urban slums of tropical regions.

To characterize the breeding ecology of R. norvegicus and provide needed information for the level of genetic mixing, which can help identify inter-connected eradication units, we estimated the occurrence of multiple paternity, distances between mothers and sires, and inbreeding in rats from urban slum habitat in Salvador, Brazil. We genotyped 9 pregnant females, their 66 offspring, and 371 males at 16 microsatellite loci. Multiple paternity was observed in 22% (2/9) of the study litters. Of the 12 sires that contributed to the 9 litters, we identified 5 (42%) of those sires among our genotyped males. Related males were captured in close proximity to pregnant females (the mean inter-parent trapping distance per litter was 70 m, +/- 58 m SD). Levels of relatedness between mother-sire pairs were higher than expected and significantly higher than relatedness between all females and non-sire males. Our findings indicate multiple paternity is common, inbreeding is apparent, and that mother-sire dyads occur in close proximity within the study area. This information is relevant to improve the spatial definition of the eradication units that may enhance the effectiveness of rodent management programs aimed at preventing human leptospirosis.

What might explain this phenomenon? We argue that Chinese urbanization is driven by two tracks rooted in the country's land ownership: 1) a state-led track relying on land financing and expropriation, facilitated capital accumulation, infrastructure construction, and the provision of public goods; 2) an informal track based on collective land ownership and self-governance resulted in informal urban villages that provide affordable housing and services to migrants. China's urbanization underscores the credibility thesis, which posits that institutional form follows from function, as the urban villages - as informal settlements - fulfil a credible function in driving urbanization by accommodating the migrant population. However, Chinese urbanization is challenged by issues of sustainability and inclusiveness, and its current credibility might not last. In this context, local policy innovations may highlight possibilities to integrate the tracks and achieve a new type of urbanization by formalization of the informal.

Age specific marital fertility rate (ASMFR) in Uttar Pradesh is highest in the age group of 20-24 years (383.9) followed by 15-19 years (271.0) age group. Use of contraceptives is also very low in this most productive age group. Among the Young married women in the age group of 15-24 years the contraceptive prevalence rate (CPR) is only 27.75% which is quite low than the target CPR of 60%.

Materials and Methods: A cross sectional study was carried out in the urban slums of Lucknow. Out of the eight Nagar-Nigam zones in Lucknow, one Urban-Primary Health Centre was selected randomly from each zone. From each Urban-Primary Health Centre, 2 slums were selected randomly. In selected slum, all the households were visited until at least 33 young married women (15-24 years) were interviewed using a pre-tested questionnaire to obtain the desired sample size of 535. The data was analyzed using SPSS 16.0. Results: Current use of contraceptives was found to be 33.8 % and almost two-thirds (66.2%) of the participants were not using any form of contraceptive method. The important reasons for non-use of contraception were embarrassment /hesitancy /shyness regarding family planning, lack of knowledge about the contraceptive method or place of availability of services, opposition to contraceptive use by husband or family members and women's desire to get pregnant. About one third of the women had no perceived need for contraception. Among the various bio-social and fertility related variables, educational attainment of the women, employment status, parity, autonomy of the women, attitude of the husband towards family planning, motivation to adopt contraceptive and contact with ANM during home visits were the prime independent predictors for non-use of contraceptives. Conclusion: The study found contraceptive use to be very low among the young married women. The findings showed that motivation of women to adopt family planning method through counseling along with provision of youth friendly services are needed to be address to achieve improvement in contraceptive use among these young married women living in urban slums.","cited":24,"publisher":"INDIAN ASSOC PREVENTIVE & SOCIAL MEDICINE","year":2017,"volume":"29","issue":"1","pages":12},{"authors":"Thaver, IH; Harpham, T; McPake, B; Garner, P","title":"Private practitioners in the slums of karachi: What quality of care do they offer?","source":"SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"Private health services have expanded in many developing countries over the last 10 yr.

Recurring of informality issues has advocated to investigate the reasons behind the 'rebound' phenomenon. This study explores the efficacy of socio-spatiality and its linkages with socio-physical liveability, taking Mumbai slum rehabs as case study. A comparative analysis of the current built-environment indicators and liveability status of major informal archetypes was performed, followed by analyses of the socio-physical problems associated with it. A critical evaluation of the rehabilitation housing of Mumbai highlights the problems caused by the current dense built environment design. Reflecting on global instances, this article demonstrates the significance of socio-spatiality and suggests environmentally sustainable indicator-based built-environment recommendations, which if implemented in the forthcoming slum rehab housing planning, would enhance well-being and liveability among the low-income sector in future. While analysing the 'rebound' phenomenon, this study delivered a heuristics of socio-physical liveability, built-environment and their respective indicators. This method would aid the architects, planners and policymakers in reshaping the forth-coming built-environment while safeguarding the socio-physical liveability of the low-income sector.","funding":"Ministry of Human Resources (MHRD) [14MHRD005]; IRCC-IIT Bombay [16IRCC561015]","cited":111,"publisher":"ELSEVIER SCI LTD","year":2020,"volume":"105","pages":18},{"authors":"NETO, UF; MARTINS, MCD; LIMA, FLD; PATRICIO, FRS; TOLEDO, MRF","title":"ASYMPTOMATIC ENVIRONMENTAL ENTEROPATHY AMONG SLUM-DWELLING INFANTS","source":"JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF NUTRITION","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"Objective: We documented asymptomatic environmental enteropathy, which may occur in low socioeconomic populations, and which is manifested by bacterial proliferation in the upper portions of the small bower and by alterations in the digestive-absorptive capacity.

Methods: This study design was a population-based cross-sectional study. Participants aged 18-60 years were recruited from randomly selected five slums of South Delhi. They were interviewed using a semi-structured interview schedule on awareness and eye health-seeking practices related to cataract. The practices were recorded if the respondents themselves or any other member of the family was diagnosed with cataract in previous 2 years. Results: A total of 1552 respondents participated in the study, of which, 89.9% had heard of cataract but only (42%) were aware of any symptom of cataract. The common symptoms of cataract reported by the participants were white opacity in eyes (25.9%) and loss of vision (20.6%). Surgery as a treatment of cataract was known to only 559 (40.1%) participants. Awareness about surgery as treatment of cataract was significantly higher among people aged 45-60 years (adjusted odds ratio = 2.89, 95% confidence interval = 2.11-3.97) and in educated people (adjusted OR = 3.69 95% CI = 2.37-5.73).

Among them, 51 (72.9%) had undergone surgery and another 19 (27.1%) had been advised to wait for surgery. Most of the operated patients 48 (94.1%) attended the postoperative follow-up. Conclusion: The study findings suggest the majority of participants have heard of cataract, but there is low awareness of its symptoms and treatment, and good eye health-seeking practices observed for cataract in urban slum population. Gaps in awareness observed can be filled up by implementing proper eye health education programs.","cited":14,"publisher":"MEDKNOW PUBLICATIONS & MEDIA PVT LTD","year":2017,"volume":"65","issue":"12","pages":6},{"authors":"Yeboah, Godwin; Porto de Albuquerque, Joao; Troilo, Rafael; Tregonning, Grant; Perera, Shanaka; Ahmed, Syed A.

To adequately detect and map them, data is needed on their location, spatial extent and evolution. High- and very high-resolution remote sensing imagery has emerged as an important source of data in this regard. The purpose of this paper is to critically review studies that have used such data to detect and map slums. Our analysis shows that while such studies have been increasing over time, they tend to be concentrated to a few geographical areas and often focus on the use of a single approach (e.g., image texture and object-based image analysis), thus limiting generalizability to understand slums, their population, and evolution within the global context. We argue that to develop a more comprehensive framework that can be used to detect and map slums, other emerging sourcing of geospatial data should be considered (e.g., volunteer geographic information) in conjunction with growing trends and advancements in technology (e.g., geosensor networks). Through such data integration and analysis we can then create a benchmark for determining the most suitable methods for mapping slums in a given locality, thus fostering the creation of new approaches to address this challenge.","cited":209,"publisher":"MDPI","year":2018,"volume":"2","issue":"1","pages":38},{"authors":"Chopra, Harsha Vipin; Gandhi, Meera Jayant; Sahariah, Sirazul Ameen; Weller, Susie; Potdar, Ramesh Dattatray; Barker, Mary; Kehoe, Sarah Helen; Fall, Caroline H.

Design: Three investigators from Mumbai conducted six focus group discussions. Setting: The study was conducted in suburban Mumbai slums. Participants: Thirty-six adolescents (aged 10-12 and 15-17 years) and twenty-three caregivers were recruited through convenience sampling. Results: The findings highlighted the complex negotiations between adolescent and caregivers surrounding adolescent junk food consumption and physical activity opportunities. Caregivers learned recipes to prepare popular junk foods to encourage adolescents to eat more home-cooked, and less 'outside', food, yet adolescents still preferred to eat outside. To adolescents, the social aspect of eating junk food with friends was an important and enjoyable experience. Caregivers felt that they had no control over adolescents' food choices, whereas adolescents felt their diets were dictated by their parents. Adolescents wanted to be physically active but were encouraged to focus on their academic studies instead. Gender was also a key driver of physical activity, with girls given less priority to use outside spaces due to cultural and religious factors, and parental fears for their safety. Conclusions: These findings show that adolescents and caregivers have different agendas regarding adolescent diet. Adolescent girls have less opportunity for healthy exercise, and are more sedentary, than boys. Adolescents and caregivers need to be involved in designing effective interventions such as making space available for girls to be active, and smartphone games to encourage healthy eating or physical activity.","funding":"Global Challenges Research Fund/Medical Research Council pump priming grantUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC) [MC_PC_MR/R018545/1]","cited":41,"publisher":"CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS","year":2021,"volume":"24","issue":"16","pages":11},{"authors":"Rahman, Azizur; Hakim, Md.

We employ logistic regression models to examine the effect of antecedent sociodemographic and risk and protective factors measured during the first wave of data collection on transition to first sex by the second wave. We observe that transition to first sex is influenced by age, slum residence, perceived parental monitoring, and peer behaviour. We also find evidence for coupling of risk behaviours.

Grey water from bathroom, laundry and kitchen activities was collected from 10 households in the Bwaise III slum in Kampala (Uganda) in separate containers, mixed in equal proportions followed by settling, prior to transferring the influent to the tanks. Column 1 was packed with lava rock to a depth of 60 cm, while column 2 was packed with lava rock (bottom 30 cm) and silica sand, which was later replaced by granular activated carbon (top 30 cm) to further investigate nutrient removal from grey water. Operating the two filter columns in series at a HLR of 20 cm/day resulted in a better effluent quality than at a higher (40 cm/day) HLR. The COD removal efficiencies by filter columns 1 and 2 in series amounted to 90% and 84% at HLR of 20 cm/day and 40 cm/day, respectively. TOC and DOC removal efficiency amounted to 77% and 71% at a HLR of 20 cm/day, but decreased to 72% and 67% at a HLR of 40 cm/day, respectively.

The Ijora community in Lagos was the highlight of this study, particularly Ijora Badia and Ijora Oloye, regarded as slums according to the UNDP report. The entire fifty-two (52) local agents in the Ijora community were surveyed in cross-sectional survey research that entailed the questionnaire's issuance. The nexus of data collection, pre-processing, data analysis, algorithm application, and model evaluation resulted in retrieving rental values within the years 2010 and 2019 on two predominant residential property types of self-contain and one-bedroom flats found within the community. Three selected algorithms, Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Machine, and Logistic Regression, were essentially used as classifiers but trained to predict the continuous values. These algorithms were implemented through the use of Python's SciKit-learn Library and RapidMiner. The findings revealed that though all three models gave accurate predictions, Logistic Regression was the highest with low error values.

Although accessing schools for these children is understood in the context of adult facilitation, their own account of agency in journey experiences is not widely reported in research. The challenge is on how preschool children affected by HIV/AIDS conceptualise agency in their mobility to and from school and how this can be methodologically studied from children's perspective. This article explores preschool children's agency in journeys to school through urban slum terrains, challenges they face and how they negotiate them. The participants were purposively sampled and they included 45 preschool orphans and vulnerable children (OVC) aged 5-to-6 years old. Data was collected via multiple qualitative methods which included conversational interviews, drawings, focus group discussions and observations. The findings showed children exercised agency through negotiations, decision-making and avoidance of real and latent risk which potentiated them with confidence, independence and autonomy. In view of these preschool OVC's subjective day-to-day experiences, age was not a limitation to agency they potent. Thus, preschool OVC within poor urban settings need to be seen in the light of their capabilities to negotiate very difficult circumstances in their daily experiences.

Tourism in Kelurahan Jodipan requires contribution and participation of the community to continue the tourism activities. Therefore, this study aims to assess the level of social capital in alleviating poverty through Pro-Poor Tourism concepts in slums. The analytical method used in this research is the Rate of Participation (RoP) analysis and Structural Equation Modeling analysis using MPLUS to know the relationship between variables and dominant factors that influence. The result of RoP analysis is the level of community participation of RW.02 Kelurahan Jodipan belongs to the low participation class. The average community follows one institutional in Kelurahan Jodipan. The results of SEM analysis is the association between social capital and tourism proportional. That is, the better the social capital in the community, the better the management of the environmental tourism. Second, the relationship between social capital and tourism with community poverty is inversely proportional. That is, the higher the social capital and the better the tourism activity then the poverty in the region will be smaller. The last result is Pro-Poor Tourism tourism activities, in this case, can reduce the poverty level of the community.","cited":14,"publisher":"GEOMATE INT SOC","year":2019,"volume":"16","issue":"55","pages":7},{"authors":"Harada, H.; Fujimori, Y.; Gomi, R.; Ahsan, Md.

The proportions of pathogenic E.coli were significantly different (P < 0.001) between wastewater (18.6%) and drinking water (1.7%). StIb-positive enterotoxigenic E.coli (ETEC) were predominant in wastewater, indicating that people in the site carried ETEC. In contrast, no ETEC was present in drinking water and the proportion of H8-positive isolates was significantly smaller (7.8%) than that in wastewater (16.3%) (P = 0.001).

We evaluated the effectiveness of group discussions and commitment in improving the cleaning behaviour of shared sanitation users in three urban slums in Kampala, Uganda. The study follows the risk, attitudes, norms, abilities and self-regulation (RANAS) model of behaviour change and some factors of the social dilemma theory. Methods: A pre-versus post-intervention survey was conducted in three slums of Kampala, Uganda, between December 2012 and September 2013. From the pre-intervention findings, users of dirty sanitation facilities were randomly assigned to discussions, discussions + commitment and control interventions. The interventions were implemented for 3 months with the aim of improving cleaning behaviour. This paper provides an analysis of 119 respondents who belonged to the intervention discussion-only (n = 38), discussions + commitment (n = 41) and the control (no intervention, n = 40) groups. Results: Compared to the control, discussions and discussions + commitment significantly improved shared toilet users' cleaning behaviour. The rate of improvement was observed through behavioural determinants such as cleaning obligation, cleaning ease, cleaning approval and affective beliefs.

Due to HIV/AIDS scourge in Kenya, it is possible that rotavirus-related gastroenteritis has been aggravated in adults. The Global Alliance for Immunizations has ranked rotavirus infection a priority for vaccine, and, to ensure its success, there is a need to document the local strain(s) circulating in different regions. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted to document human rotavirus group A serotypes in children below 5 years and HIV-infected adults in Viwandani slum in Nairobi, Kenya. A total of 260 (128 from children and 132 from HIV infected adults) fecal specimen samples were analyzed from August 2012 to July 2013. Screening for rotavirus was done by antigen based enzyme immune-sorbent assay (ELISA), Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) was used to detect rotavirus electropherotypes and finally genotyping was done by RT-PCR using genotype-specific primer sets targeting VP4 and VP7 genes. RESULTS: Rotavirus was detected in 23% and 8% of children and adult, respectively. Prevalence was high in children of < 2 years and adults of > 48 years. Long electropherotypes accounted for 80% and 60% while short electropherotypes accounted for 20% and 40% in children and adult, respectively. The common globally distributed strains, G1 and G3, accounted for 60% detections while the unusual G9 strain accounted for 80% infection in adults. G1P[8] was the common genotypic combination in children, accounting for 40% infection, whereas G9[P8] accounted for 60% of the infections in adults. CONCLUSION: This study shows the existence of strain diversity between rotavirus circulating in children and adults within this study group. It further shows that as currently constituted, the 2 vaccines recommended for rotavirus would cover the circulating strain in Viwandani slum. Finally, there is a need for continuous rotavirus strain surveillance in children and a further focus on HIV infected adults.","cited":31,"publisher":"JIMMA UNIV, ETHIOPIA","year":2015,"volume":"25","issue":"1","pages":8},{"authors":"Okimiji, Oluwaseun Princess; Techato, Kuaanan; Simon, John Nyandansobi; Tope-Ajayi, Opeyemi Oluwaseun; Okafor, Angela Tochukwu; Aborisade, Moses Akintayo; Phoungthong, Khamphe","title":"Spatial Pattern of Air Pollutant Concentrations and Their Relationship with Meteorological Parameters in Coastal Slum Settlements of Lagos, Southwestern Nigeria","source":"ATMOSPHERE","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"This study assessed the spatial disposition of air pollutants and their relationship with meteorological parameters in urban slum settlements of Lagos city.

This study therefore examined local notions regarding male partners' involvement in family planning (FP) adoption by women in two selected urban slums areas in Nigeria - Ibadan (Southwest region) and Kaduna (Northwest region). Specifically, the study investigated women's narratives about FP, perceived barriers from male partners regarding FP adoption by the women and how women negotiate male partners' cooperation for FP use. Methods: Sixteen FGD sessions were conducted with selected groups of men and women, stratified by sex, age group, and FP experience using a vignette to generate discussions. Sessions were facilitated by experienced social scientists and audio-taped, with note-taker also present. The transcribed data were analyzed with Atlas.ti software version 7. Inductive approach was employed to analyze the data. Reasons given for FP attitudes and use are presented in a network format while critical discourse analysis was also used in generating relevant tables. Results: The finding shows that women in the selected communities expressed desire for FP adoption. Three main reasons largely accounted for the desire to use FP: perceived need to space childbirth, family's financial condition and the potential adverse effect of high fertility on the woman's health. Male partners' support for the use of FP by women was perceived to be low, which is due to misconceptions about FP and traditional pro-natalistic beliefs and tendencies. Mechanisms by which women negotiate their male-partner's cooperation for FP adoption include seeking the support of the partner's significant others and advice from older women. Conclusion: To significantly improve family planning adoption rates among urban slum dwellers in Nigeria, there is the need to specifically and specially target men alongside their female partners as well as other stakeholders who have significant influences at family and community level.","funding":"Nigeria Urban Reproductive Health Initiative (NURHI); Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, USA; Population and Reproductive Health Programme, Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, Nigeria; University of the Western Cape through Flemish Inter-University (VLIR) postdoctoral fellowship","cited":47,"publisher":"BMC","year":2014,"volume":"14","pages":14},{"authors":"Velusamy, Vasanthakumar; Premkumar, Prasanna S.; Kang, Gagandeep","title":"Exclusive breastfeeding practices among mothers in urban slum settlements: pooled analysis from three prospective birth cohort studies in South India","source":"INTERNATIONAL BREASTFEEDING JOURNAL","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"Background: The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends six months of exclusive breastfeeding.

METHODS We conducted a cluster-randomised controlled trial among users of 1226 shared toilets in 23 Dhaka slums. We assessed baseline toilet cleanliness in January 2015. The six-month intervention included provision of hardware (bin for solid waste, 4 l flushing bucket, 70 l water reservoir), and behaviour change communication (compound meetings, interpersonal household sessions, signs depicting rules for toilet use). We estimated the adjusted difference in difference (DID) to assess outcomes and accounted for clustering effects using generalised estimating equations. RESULTS Compared to controls, intervention toilets were more likely to have water available inside toilet cubicles (DID: +4.7%, 95% CI: 0.2, 9.2), access to brush/broom for cleaning (DID: +8.4%, 95% CI: 2, 15) and waste bins (DID: + 63%, 95% CI: 59, 66), while less likely to have visible faeces inside the pan (DID: -13%, 95% CI: -19, -5), the smell of faeces (DID: -7.6%, 95% CI: -14, -1.3) and household waste inside the cubicle (DID: -4%, 95% CI: -7, -1).

Culturalism and the underclass-debate: a cri que. 'Culture' is back on the agenda in German geography Although this development was partly triggered by the import of concepts from Anglo-American 'new cultural geography', one of the most important strands of this literature is practically absent from the debate: the contributions of radical geographers grounded in historical-materialist social theory As a consequence, it is argued that a fundamental critique of the ideological functioning of culturalist argumentations is still missing. The article proposes such a critique in two parts. First, the structure of culturalism is criticized for being both tautological, explaining 'cultural phenomena' with 'culture', and ideological in that it abstracts from the political nature of social phenomena by treating them as 'cultural'. The task of a radical cultural geography that follows from this critique is to ask: who argues culturalistically and why? Second, the functioning of the culturalist ideology is illustrated by revisiting the contributions by MURRAY (1984), WILSON (1987) and ANDERSON (1999) to the US-American 'underclass-debare'. All three approaches, it is argued, abstract from the socioeconomic reasons for the existence of Afro-American ghettos in US cities by treating them, in different ways, as 'cultural' phenomena. In doing so, all three authors play into the hands, wittingly or not, of neoliberal pauperization policies.","cited":82,"publisher":"BOSS DRUCK MEDIEN GMBH","year":2008,"volume":"62","issue":"1","pages":12},{"authors":"Islam, Mirajul; Sultana, Nasrin","title":"Risk factors for pregnancy related complications among urban slum and non-slum women in Bangladesh","source":"BMC PREGNANCY AND CHILDBIRTH","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"BackgroundBangladesh is facing a higher maternal mortality and morbidity than many other developing countries in the world. The majority of these maternal deaths occur due to pregnancy related complications. Although health facilities in urban areas in Bangladesh are widely available, women living in underprivileged urban areas are least likely to receive the maternal health services and as a result, they face more pregnancy related complications. Unfortunately, there are only a few studies on complications during maternal and delivery period in these areas. We aim to investigate the factors responsible for pregnancy related complications in urban slum and non-slum areas.MethodsData from the Urban Health Survey (UHS), 2013 were analyzed applying mixed logistic regression model. The response variable was complications during pregnancy, during/after delivery at the last birth and the total sample size was 6137. The adjusted odds ratios (AORs) along with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were also calculated to compare the magnitude of different risk factors for the pregnancy related complications.ResultsYounger mothers (age<18years) at the birth of their children had 24% (OR=1.24, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.54) more odds to experience complications during pregnancy/delivery or after delivery compared to older mothers aged 18 to 35years. The increased risk of complications was found among primiparous women. Women living in urban slum areas had higher pregnancy related complications than women living elsewhere. Migrant mothers faced more complications than women-who were not migrants. Women had greater pregnancy related complications when they delivered boy child than girl child, presumably from an increased size of the baby and resultant birth obstruction, assisted delivery and post partum haemorrhage. Moreover, a wanted pregnancy had fewer significant complications during pregnancy/delivery or after delivery than an unwanted pregnancy.ConclusionsThe study associates early maternal age, primiparity, unwanted pregnancy, women living in slum areas, women migrating from other cities or non-urban areas and NGO membership with increased risk of pregnancy related complications among urban women in Bangladesh. It is likely that addressing these risk factors for complications to the policymakers may help to reduce the maternal mortality and morbidity in Bangladesh.","cited":21,"publisher":"BMC","year":2019,"volume":"19","pages":7},{"authors":"Khatun, Halima; Comins, Carly A.; Shah, Rajesh; Islam, M.

Yet the understanding of why these practices are suboptimal, especially surrounding urban slum dwelling mothers, is unclear. The purpose of this study was to assess early infant feeding practices, examine associations with maternal factors, and uncover the facilitators and barriers to early feeding practices in selected slums of Dhaka, Bangladesh. Methods: A mixed method study was conducted from June to September 2016 using both quantitative and qualitative methods among mothers with children under the age of 6 months. The survey included 342 mother-infant pairs and 18 in-depth interviews were conducted. Univariate and multiple logistic regression was used to determine status of early infant feeding practices and factors associated with exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) within the previous 24 h. Transcripts were coded to uncover the facilitators and barriers surrounding early infant feeding practices. Results: Sixty four percent (220/342) of mothers initiated breastfeeding within 1 h, 96.5% (330/342) reported feeding colostrum, and 36.3% (124/342) infants were EBF in the last 24 h.

During the 18 interviews, eight mothers reported a cesarean delivery and none of these mothers initiated breastfeeding within 1 h or exclusively breastfed. Moreover, all eight mothers gave their infants prelacteal feeds. Conclusions: The status of early infant feeding practices in Dhaka's slums was poor.

The word is also dangerous because it confuses the physical problem of poor quality housing with the characteristics of the people living there. The UN knows that earlier research has rehabilitated most 'slum dwellers' but ignores the danger of conjuring up all of the old images. In the process, the campaign also offers an oblique invitation to governments to look for instant solutions to insoluble problems.

I specifically show how the statistically rigorous calculative practices of the first moment encountered various technical difficulties and political challenges in producing a governing intelligibility, thus leading to the unruliness of slum space. In response, a new set of governmental techniques operating through the dissemination of aesthetic norms and codes re-secured rule over slums. I describe this shift in governmental technique to demonstrate that the dissemination of aesthetic norms can be both more governmentally effective and practically implementable than the statistical deployment of governmental truths. This suggests the need to expand our understanding of the epistemology of government to include attention to a more diverse array of governmental technologies, some more aesthetic than strictly calculative.","cited":77,"publisher":"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","year":2010,"volume":"39","issue":"2","pages":33},{"authors":"Ali, Syed Imran","title":"Alternatives for safe water provision in urban and peri-urban slums","source":"JOURNAL OF WATER AND HEALTH","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"In response to rapid urbanization throughout the global South, urban and peri-urban slums are expanding at an alarming rate.

Alternative decentralized water treatment systems have been promoted in recent years as a means of achieving rapid health gains among vulnerable populations. Though much work with decentralized systems, especially in urban environments, has been at the household level, there is also considerable potential for development at the community level. Both levels of approach have unique sets of advantages and disadvantages that, just as with treatment technologies, may make certain options more appropriate than others in a particular setting.

Migration is more intense during early adulthood (20-24), and despite very similar determinants across gender, mobility is more intense among women compared to men. The increasing feminization of migration is likely to change the face of slum settlements, resulting in more balanced sex ratios, in line with city-wide trends in Nairobi over the past half century.

Thus factors contributing to overall individual wellbeing, beyond health benefits, drive adoption and use of the low-cost personal sanitation solution studied.

In 2013, Medecins Sans Frontieres initiated an urban healthcare programme in these areas providing services for factory workers and responding to the sexual and reproductive health needs of young women. Little in-depth information is available on perceptions of health and health seeking behaviour in this population. We aimed to provide a better understanding of community perceptions toward health and health care in order to inform programme strategies.MethodsIn-depth interviews were conducted with women (n=13); factory workers (n=14); and key informants (n=13). Participants were selected using purposive maximum variation sampling and voluntarily consented to take part. Topic guides steered participant-led interviews, which were audio-recorded, translated and transcribed from Bangla into English. By comparing cases, we identified emerging themes, patterns and relationships in the data. NVivo11 (c) was used to sort and code the data.ResultsEmerging themes indicated that in Kamrangirchar and Hazaribagh, health is seen as an asset necessary for work and, thus, for survival.

Health care seeking for serious' conditions is characterised by uncertainty, confusion, and unsatisfactory results. Decisions are made communally and shaped by collective perceptions of quality care.

Quality care' is perceived as comprehensive care under one roof,' including predictive biomedical diagnostics and effective medication, delivered through a trusting relationship with the care provider.ConclusionsHealth seeking behaviour of slum dwellers of Kamrangirchar and Hazaribagh is based on competing priorities, where quick and effective care is key, focussed on the ability to work and generate income. This takes place in a fragmented healthcare system characterised by mistrust of providers, and where navigation is informed by word-of-mouth experiences of peers. Improving health in this context demands a comprehensive and integrated approach to health care delivery, with an emphasis on rapid diagnosis, effective treatment and referral, and improved trust in care providers. Health education must be developed in collaboration with the community to identify knowledge gaps, support decision-making, and be channelled through existing networks. Further research should consider the effectiveness of interventions aiming to improve the practice of pharmacists.","cited":49,"publisher":"BMC","year":2019,"volume":"19","pages":13},{"authors":"Vilar, Katila; Cartes, Ivan","title":"Urban design and social capital in slums.

Our objectives were to describe the prevalence of IPV during pregnancy and after delivery in an urban slum setting, to review its social determinants, and to explore its effects on maternal and newborn health. Methods: We did a cross-sectional study nested within the data collection system for a concurrent trial. Through urban community surveillance, we identified births in 48 slum areas and interviewed mothers similar to 6 weeks later. After collecting information on demographic characteristics, socioeconomic indicators, and maternal and newborn care, we asked their opinions on the justifiability of IPV and on their experience of it in the last 12 months. Results: Of 2139 respondents, 35% (748) said that violence was justifiable if a woman disrespected her in-laws or argued with her husband, failed to provide good food, housework and childcare, or went out without permission. 318 (15%, 95% CI 13, 16%) reported IPV in the year that included pregnancy and the postpartum period. Physical IPV was reported by 247 (12%, 95% CI 10, 13%), sexual IPV by 35 (2%, 95% CI 1, 2%), and emotional IPV by 167 (8%, 95% CI 7, 9). 219 (69%) women said that the likelihood of IPV was either unaffected by or increased during maternity. IPV was more likely to be reported by women from poorer families and when husbands used alcohol. Although 18% of women who had suffered physical IPV sought clinical care for their injuries, seeking help from organizations outside the family to address IPV itself was rare. Women who reported IPV were more likely to have reported illness during pregnancy and use of modern methods of family planning. They were more than twice as likely to say that there were situations in which violence was justifiable (odds ratio 2.6, 95% CI 1.7, 3.4). Conclusions: One in seven women suffered IPV during or shortly after pregnancy. The elements of the violent milieu are mutually reinforcing and need to be taken into account collectively in responding to both individual cases and framing public health initiatives.","funding":"Wellcome TrustWellcome TrustEuropean Commission [100714, 091561] Funding Source: Medline","cited":81,"publisher":"BMC","year":2013,"volume":"13","pages":12},{"authors":"Naved, Ruchira Tabassum; Khan, Nur Newaz","title":"Multilevel Control Over Sexuality of Unmarried Adolescent Girls and Related Violence: A Qualitative Exploration in Slums of Dhaka, Bangladesh","source":"JOURNAL OF INTERPERSONAL VIOLENCE","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"High concerns about sexuality of unmarried adolescent girls (UAGs) in patriarchal societies and perceived links between sexuality and honor are likely to trigger controlling behavior and underlie a range of violence perpetrated against them. These concerns are heightened in the urban slums of Bangladesh, where economic and social changes challenge traditional gender roles and behaviors. Little is, however, known about control of and violence against UAGs perpetrated by families, romantic partners, and community. Using 12 key informant interviews, 15 focus group discussions, and 27 in-depth interviews carried out between June and November 2011 in Dhaka slums, this study explores the sociocultural expectations around sexuality of UAGs, how they interact with ground reality, control, resultant conflicts, violence against UAGs, and the ways UAGs grapple with controlling behavior and violence. The findings show that perceptions, attitudes, and expectations about the behavior of these girls remain patriarchal despite changes in economic and social circumstances reshaping gender roles and practices. Patriarchy finds new ways of controlling the girls by imposing dress codes, setting new boundaries for mobility and interaction with the opposite sex, and inflicting different forms of violence at different levels of the society. Some girls attempt to avoid violence by conforming to the new rules, while many negotiate the new boundaries with the family, romantic partner, and community. UAGs sometimes make compromises in one domain or level, while they resist control and violence in another. The findings lend support to the patriarchal bargain theory. Promotion of nonpatriarchal norms is expected to reduce vulnerability of these girls to violence.","funding":"Embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands [GR-00811]","cited":36,"publisher":"SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC","year":2021,"volume":"36","issue":"15-16","pages":23},{"authors":"Durey, Jill Felicity","title":"John Galsworthy and Slum Clearance","source":"TEXAS STUDIES IN LITERATURE AND LANGUAGE","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"Galsworthy's dialogistic naturalism was understated to convince readers that they themselves needed to help correct social injustices.

The study documents that there was significantly increased risk of PEM if the child is not exclusive breastfed for 6 months.","cited":10,"publisher":"IBN SINA TRUST","year":2016,"volume":"15","issue":"1","pages":5},{"authors":"Sarkar, Anindita","title":"Everyday practices of poor urban women to access water: Lived realities from a Nairobi slum","source":"AFRICAN STUDIES","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"Women living in low-income areas and informal settlements in the cities regularly have to undergo hardships to access water from overstressed shared water sources in the absence of individual utility piped connections within their premises. Drawing from an ethnographic research in the Mathare slums of Nairobi, this study looks at the 'daily' 'multiple' and 'repetitive' actions that women particularly engage to 'fetch', 'store' and 'save' water for themselves and their families. Besides the woes of finding a running tap and wasting valuable time waiting in the queues, procuring water entails physical hardship that often leads to mental agony that sometimes even threatens the safety and dignity of these women's lives. Since water supply is frequently interrupted for several days, women struggle to store water, design innovative ways for their families to save water and even cut back on their own water usage at the cost of their health and hygiene to cope with water shortages. Thus, poor urban women experience 'everyday sufferings from water' as their everyday choices to access water are restricted by their individual assessment of household water requirements, ownership of assets and their ability to access agencies of power.","funding":"University Grants Commission, India, under the Research Award Programme 2016-19University Grants Commission, India","cited":64,"publisher":"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","year":2020,"volume":"79","issue":"2","pages":20},{"authors":"Erman, Tahire; Hatiboglu, Burcu","title":"Rendering responsible, provoking desire: women and home in squatter/slum renewal projects in the Turkish context","source":"GENDER PLACE AND CULTURE","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"This article is situated at the intersection of urban restructuring, cultural conservatism and neoliberalism in the Turkish context to understand the new subject formations of poor women as they are relocated to high-rise apartment blocks in slum/squatter renewal projects by the prospect of homeownership via long-term mortgage loans.

It draws upon two ethnographic studies that reveal women's experiences embedded both in neoliberalism and patriarchy. In neoliberalism, women's participation in the informal job market was promoted as they were made responsible for contributing to mortgage payments, and they were brought into consumption as they were provoked the desire for good homes via furnishing, and in patriarchy, women's traditional roles in social reproduction were demanded in spite of their new roles and responsibilities. The study ponders women's differentiated negotiations with patriarchy which resisted radical challenges when the family and the home framed women's new responsibilities and desires.

It not only analyses income poverty but also looks at derivation of access to basic services including water, sanitation and drainage. The purpose of this paper is to compare and contrast the income and non-income deprivation of childbearing and non-childbearing households. Design/methodology/approach - The study is based on a survey of 541 sample households selected from 23 slums of Kolkata, India. The authors have adopted a mixture of cluster sampling and systematic sampling technique. The slums of Kolkata have been segregated into three regions and further segregated by overlaying the population and average monthly income of slums. Slums have been selected randomly from these stratums. Households have been selected from the slums by systematic sampling method. Findings - The Muslim and backward caste households are more deprived with respect to income and access to basic services as compared to Hindu general (upper) caste. Deprivations with respect to income and basic services are more pronounced for households having child than for households not having child. Childbearing households are less likely to receive better water supply, sanitation and drainage services as compared to others due to their religious and residential identities. Slum children get affected by the complex political economy of basic service delivery. The study also finds that electoral competition has positive and political clientelism has negative impact on access to basic services. Research limitations/implications - The study is based on results obtained from survey in one city of India. Hence, these results cannot be generalized for India or for the developing countries taken together. Further studies across cities of developing countries are required to arrive at any generalized conclusion. Practical implications - The study suggests that public policies should attempt to disentangle minorities and children from the local political economy. Otherwise, deprivation and disparity even across low income households living in slums would persist. Deprivation of child bearing households would lead to a deteriorating future for the slum children. Social implications - This paper have pave the path for new generation public policy for the urban poor and minorities. Originality/value - This paper highlights the incidence of deprivation of minorities and childbearing households vis-a-vis other households in the slums.

The case for public expenditure on typhoid Vi polysaccharide vaccines for two low-income, high-incidence slums (Narkeldanga and Tiljala) in Kolkata, India, was examined. Three measures of the economic benefits of the vaccines were used: private and public cost-of-illness (COI) avoided; avoided COI plus mortality risk-reduction benefits; and willingness-to-pay (WTP) derived from stated preference (contingent valuation) studies conducted in Tiljala in 2004. Benefits and costs were examined from a social perspective. The study represents a unique opportunity to evaluate typhoid-vaccine programmes using a wealth of new site-specific epidemiological and economic data. Three typhoid-vaccination strategies (targeting only enrolled school children, targeting all children, and targeting adults and children) would most likely pass a social cost-benefit test, unless benefits are restricted to include only avoided COI. All three strategies would be considered 'very cost-effective' using the standard comparisons of cost per disability-adjusted life-year avoided with per-capita gross domestic product. However, at an average total cost per immunized person of similar to US$ 1.1, a typhoid-vaccination programme would absorb a sixth of existing public-sector spending on health (on a per-capita basis) in India. Because there appears to be significant private economic demand for typhoid vaccines, the Government could design a financially-sustainable programme with user-fees. The results show that a programme where adults pay a higher fee to subsidize vaccines for children (who have higher incidence) would avoid more cases than a uniform user-fee and still achieve revenue-neutrality.","cited":38,"publisher":"ICDDR B","year":2009,"volume":"27","issue":"6","pages":14},{"authors":"Murarkar, Sujata; Gothankar, Jayashree; Doke, Prakash; Pore, Prasad; Lalwani, Sanjay; Dhumale, Girish; Quraishi, Sanjay; Patil, Reshma; Waghachavare, Vivek; Dhobale, Randhir; Rasote, Kirti; Palkar, Sonali; Malshe, Nandini","title":"Prevalence and determinants of undernutrition among under-five children residing in urban slums and rural area, Maharashtra, India: a community-based cross-sectional study","source":"BMC PUBLIC HEALTH","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"BackgroundUndernutrition among under five children in India is a major public health problem. Despite India's growth in the economy, the child mortality rate due to undernutrition is still high in both urban and rural areas. Studies that focus on urban slums are scarce. Hence the present study was carried out to assess the prevalence and determinants of undernutrition in children under five in Maharashtra, India.MethodsA community-based cross-sectional study was conducted in 16 randomly selected clusters in two districts of Maharashtra state, India. Data were collected through house to house survey by interviewing mothers of under five children. Total 2929 mothers and their 3671 under five children were covered. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was carried out to identify the determinants of child nutritional status seperately in urban and rural areas.ResultsThe mean age of the children was 2.38years (SD 1.36) and mean age of mothers was 24.25years ( SD 6.37). Overall prevalence of stunting among children under five was 45.9%, wasting was 17.1 and 35.4% children were underweight. Prevalence of wasting, stunting and underweight were more seen in an urban slum than a rural area. In the rural areas exclusive breast feeding (p<0.001) and acute diarrhea (p=0.001) were associated with wasting, children with birth order 2 or less than 2 were associated with stunting and exclusive breast feeding (p<0.05) and low maternal education were associated with underweight. Whereas in the urban slums exclusive breast feeding (p<0.05) was associated with wasting, sex of the child (p<0.05) and type of family (p<0.05) were associated with stunting,and low income of the family (p<0.05) was associated with underweight.Conclusions Factors like sex of the child, birth order,exclusive breast feeding,economic status of the family, type of family,acute diarrhea and maternal education have influence on nutritional status of the child.

Methods: A cross-sectional survey was carried on 436 mates aged 18-60 years in a slum area called Bidhan Colony, which is approximately 15 km from Kolkata city. Data on anthropometric measurements and blood pressure were collected, following standard techniques. Logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis were used for testing the relationship between BMI and PBF relative to hypertension. Results: About 4.25% and 50% of the normal (BMI 18.5-22.9 kg/m(2)) and overweight (BMI 23.0-24.9 kg/m(2)) subjects, respectively, were obese according to the PBF cutoff point of >25%. The ROC curve analysis indicated that the BMI cut-off >= 23 kg/m(2) was appropriate for detecting obesity relative to hypertension. It was observed that the prevalence of hypertension increased significantly with age (r = 0.226, p < 0.001). Adjusting for age, the subjects with BMI 23-24.99 kg/m(2) had about 3.2 times (95% CI: 1.61-6.27) greater risk of hypertension than those with BMI < 23 kg/m(2), and the risk for those with BMI >= 25 kg/m(2) was about 4.5 times (95% CI: 2.06-9.57). As for PBF, the risk of hypertension was about 2.6 times (95% CI: 1.38-4.80) for the subjects with PBF > 25% compared to those with PBF <= 25%.

To integrate the zero-inflated track plate data we developed a two-component mixture model with one binary and one censored continuous component. Track plate mark-intensity was highly correlated with signs of rodent infestation (all coefficients between 0.61 and 0.79 and all p-values < 0.05). Moreover, the mean level of pre-trapping rat-mark intensity on plates was significantly associated with the number of rats captured subsequently (Odds ratio1.38; 95 % CI 1.19-1.61) and declined significantly following trapping (Odds ratio 0.86; 95 % CI 0.78-0.95). Track plates provided robust proxy measurements of rat abundance and distribution and detected rat presence even when populations appeared 'trapped out'. Tracking plates are relatively easy and inexpensive methods that can be used to intensively sample settings such as urban slums, where traditional trapping or mark-recapture studies are impossible to implement, and therefore the results can inform and assess the impact of targeted urban rodent control campaigns.","funding":"Oswaldo Cruz Foundation; Secretariat of Health Surveillance, Brazilian Ministry of Health; Yale Institute for Biospheric Studies Doctoral Dissertation Improvement program; Fulbright Fellowship program; National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [F31 AI114245, R01 AI052473, U01 AI088752, R01 TW009504, R25 TW009338]; Wellcome TrustWellcome TrustEuropean Commission [102330/Z/ 13/Z]; FOGARTY INTERNATIONAL CENTERUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Fogarty International Center (FIC) [R01TW009504, R25TW009338] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [U01AI088752, R01AI121207, F31AI114245, R01AI052473] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","cited":61,"publisher":"SPRINGER","year":2016,"volume":"19","issue":"2","pages":15},{"authors":"Huda, Fauzia Akhter; Ahmed, Anisuddin; Mahmood, Hassan R.; Ahmmed, Faisal; Panza, Alessio; Somrongthong, Ratana","title":"Delaying first pregnancy in reducing burden of unintended pregnancy among married adolescents in urban slums of Bangladesh A situation analysis","source":"JOURNAL OF HEALTH RESEARCH","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to assess the effect of delaying first pregnancy in reducing burden of unintended pregnancy (UP) among married adolescent girls in urban slums of Bangladesh.

Research mostly focuses on the role of the mother in child feeding, as she spends significantly more time with children. However, the role of fathers, their parenting skills, and child-feeding practices may also affect child development and eating behavior, independent of maternal factors. To our knowledge, there is limited research on the role of the father in child undernutrition, especially in the Indian context. Thus, the aim of this study was to address this knowledge gap and to explore paternal child-feeding patterns, their involvement in feeding, and its association with malnutrition in the slums. Methods: This community-based, cross-sectional study was conducted in an urban slum in Bangalore. The study included 210 father-child dyads. The Caregiver's Feeding Styles Questionnaire was used to assess paternal involvement in parenting and feeding. Anthropometry measurements were taken using standardized methods. Nutritional status was classified according to the growth standards of the World Health Organization. Logistic regression was used to test the association between paternal parenting style and malnutrition. Results: We recruited 116 boys and 94 girls and their fathers. The mean age of the children was 15.94 mo (SD 4.85). One-fourth of the fathers were illiterate and most of the families belonged to the middle class. Almost half of the fathers fed their children once a day (57.1%) and engaged them during feeding by telling stories (47.1%). The most common paternal feeding style was uninvolved (36%) followed by authoritative (29.5%). Prevalence of undernutrition, stunting, and wasting was 44.3%, 42.8%, and 9.5%, respectively. Religion, type of family, and per capita income were independently associated with uninvolved feeding style. There was no association between paternal child-feeding style malnutrition (P > 0.05) Conclusion: The present study explored the dimensions of paternal involvement in child feeding in a slum setting and its effect on child nutrition.

The chronic type is the most prevalent one. However, although rates may be considered as alarming (even more in rural areas), only one of these studies contains information about intake characteristics, using 24-hour recalls (R24). That is, it lacks some other systems, adapted to the gastronomical characteristics of their regions and to the bioavailability of food in each area, in order to locate the origin of this situation and, thus, propose truly effective and efficient solutions. Aim: To determine the nutritional value of the main dishes consumed by the residents of a slum in Peruvian Amazon. Methods: Ninety-eight participants completed three 24-h recalls. Based on these data, we selected the 25 most commonly eaten dishes and evaluated their nutritional composition. We took note of the homemade recipes, weights and measures. In addition, we observed preparation and cooking. The mean nutritional composition of each dish was calculated per 100 g using the Nutriplato 4.6. software. We also calculated gains or losses resulting from culinary treatments. Results: Within those which include milk, the highest energy density is the mingado de arroz. In the group of fish, the most energetic is pescado frito, while within meat-based recipes tallarin con polio, res asada and chancho frito are the most energetic ones. Regarding prepared dishes, the juane is the highest energy density of all recipes. Inside garnish, using bananas as the main ingredient, platano frito and madurito are the most energetic. Fats are higher in fried dishes and those which contribute most fat ratio. The same thing happens with garnish as 100 grams of platano frito or madurito contain more than 70% of the RDA. Res asada and juane present the highest sodium level. Conclusions: If we wish to offer healthier dishes, it is necessary to change their composition and/or cooking methods, reducing the consumption of fried foods. Sodium intake should also be reduced. Two foods could be important to that aim: menudencia de polio, rich in B vitamins and low in fat, and frijol hervido, which is rich in vegetable protein and, with rice dishes ubiquitous in this area, increases the biological value of ingested proteins.","cited":28,"publisher":"AULA MEDICA EDICIONES","year":2016,"volume":"33","issue":"1","pages":10},{"authors":"Imoto, Saori; Otsuki, Toshio","title":"Establishment and development process of nonformal school environments in a Nairobi slum: Focusing on the relationship between the school and the local community","source":"JAPAN ARCHITECTURAL REVIEW","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"This paper found the following environmental setting characteristics of nonformal schools in a Nairobi slum: (i) The schools tend to move from rental houses to their own properties.

Diabetes and hypertension, major risk factors for CVD, are highly prevalent among the urban poor in Africa, but treatment options are often limited in such settings. This study reports on the results of an intervention for the treatment of diabetes and hypertension for adult residents of two slums in Nairobi, Kenya. Methods: After setting up two clinics in two slums in Nairobi, hypertension and/or diabetes patients were seen by a clinician monthly. Socio-demographic characteristics and clinical data were collected over a 34-month period. Records were analyzed for 726 patients who visited the clinics at least once to determine clinic attendance and compliance patterns using survival analysis. We also examined changes in systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and random blood glucose (RBG) during the course of the program. Results: There was poor compliance with clinic attendance as only 3.4 % of patients attended the clinics on a regular (monthly) basis throughout the 34-month period. 75 % of hypertension patients were not compliant after four visits and 27 % of patients had only one clinic visit. Significant reduction of mean SBP and DBP (150.4 mmHg to 141.5 mmHg, P=.003, and 89.3 mmHg to 83.2 mmHg, P<.001) was seen for all patients that stayed in care for at least one year. Conclusions: Establishing a preventative care and treatment system in low resource settings for CVD is challenging due to high dropout rates and non-compliance. Innovative strategies are needed to ensure that benefits of treatment programs are sustained for long-term CVD risk reduction in poor urban populations.","funding":"World Diabetes Foundation [WDF08-399]; Wellcome Trust UKWellcome Trust [WT092775MA]; William and Flora Hewlett Foundation [2009-40510]; Swedish International Cooperation Agency (SIDA) [2011-001578]; Rockefeller Foundation [2009SCG302]","cited":31,"publisher":"BMC","year":2015,"volume":"15","pages":9},{"authors":"Alam, Khurshid; Khan, Jahangir A.

BRAC, a large NGO in Bangladesh, is a pioneer in this area, has been using female CHWs as core workers in its community-based health programs since 1977. After 25 years of implementing of the CHW model in rural areas, BRAC has begun using female CHWs in urban slums through a community-based maternal health intervention. However, BRAC experiences high dropout rates among CHWs suggesting a need to better understand the impact of their dropout which would help to reduce dropout and increase program sustainability. The main objective of the study was to estimate impact of dropout of volunteer CHWs from both BRAC and community perspectives. Also, we estimated cost of possible strategies to reduce dropout and compared whether these costs were more or less than the costs borne by BRAC and the community. Methods: We used the 'ingredient approach' to estimate the cost of recruiting and training of CHWs and the so-called 'friction cost approach' to estimate the cost of replacement of CHWs after adapting. Finally, we estimated forgone services in the community due to CHW dropout applying the concept of the friction period. Results: In 2009, average cost per regular CHW was US$ 59.28 which was US$ 60.04 for an ad-hoc CHW if a CHW participated a three-week basic training, a one-day refresher training, one incentive day and worked for a month in the community after recruitment. One month absence of a CHW with standard performance in the community meant substantial forgone health services like health education, antenatal visits, deliveries, referrals of complicated cases, and distribution of drugs and health commodities. However, with an additional investment of US$ 121 yearly per CHW BRAC could save another US$ 60 invested an ad-hoc CHW plus forgone services in the community. Conclusion: Although CHWs work as volunteers in Dhaka urban slums impact of their dropout is immense both in financial term and forgone services. High cost of dropout makes the program less sustainable. However, simple and financially competitive strategies can improve the sustainability of the program.","funding":"Bill & Melinda Gates FoundationBill & Melinda Gates Foundation","cited":19,"publisher":"BMC","year":2012,"volume":"12","pages":9},{"authors":"Tomlinson, Richard","title":"Dentists, politicians and policy professionals: the prescriptive character of best practice 'knowledge products' for slum upgrading","source":"INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT PLANNING REVIEW","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"This article is based on the view that policy professionals are considerably influenced by Web-based searches and social media communications that lead to the identification of best practice policy documents.

Goal 7 of the MDGs aims to improve the living conditions of 100 million slum dwellers by 2020. However, current estimates suggest that, at present, there are nearly I billion people living in slums, and that this number is projected to increase to 1.5 billion by 2020 and to 2 billion by 2030. Thus, even achieving the MDG would be to manage a retreat rather than achieve significant progress. The important policy objective for governments and the international community, therefore, is dramatically to exceed, not just meet, this MDG. This can best be achieved by adopting a twin-track approach towards existing and potential future slums, Innovative approaches to improving tenure security in existing unauthorized settlements can improve living conditions for current slum dwellers, while revising regulatory frameworks can reduce the need for future slums by significantly improving access to legal land and shelter. This paper provides evidence from recent research, which suggests that intermediate tenure options, combined with regulatory audits of planning regulations, standards and administrative procedures, can significantly improve living conditions within the human, technical and financial resources available.

We used the 24-hour diet recall to study dietary diversity and a food frequency questionnaire for consumption of food groups during the preceding week. ICFI was computed using five components, namely, breastfeeding, use of bottle, dietary diversity score (DDS), food group frequency score (FGFS) and feeding frequency scores (FFS).

Results: The mean total ICFI score for all was 5.9 +/- 1.9. Among the five components, FGFS and FFS differed between children <12 months of age and >12 months and by breast feeding status. In contrast, there were no differences vis-a-vis dietary diversity scores (DDS), breast feeding, and use of bottle. Non-breastfed children had significantly higher DDS scores than did breastfed children.

By analyzing the case study of an upgrading project in Mahali, an (anonymized) informal settlement in Nairobi, Kenya, the importance of rumour for development in practice is revealed. That importance is two-fold: first of all, it is a tool to fulfil personal interests in the interfactional negotiation over project resources, e.g. land, and the related power struggles. Second, it is a tool of sense-making and expression of agency in the uncertain context of a development project. Current literature notably describes development as a process of assemblage rife with gaps and with a tendency to exclude (local/supralocal) political-economic processes from its plans. In such a context, limited access to reliable information pushes people towards the alternative source of information that is rumour. The article looks into the factors contributing to rumour, specifically residents' experience of past events, interfactional conflicts over power and contextual uncertainty. It also discusses the combined effects of rumour on the slum upgrading intervention. Rumour has a definite effect on power struggles between factions as well as the livelihoods of other, less powerful, residents (for instance through displacement). It decreases the trust residents have in a development project as well as their willingness to invest time and effort in that project. Instead, it instigates conflict and occasionally even violence. However, rumour may also be considered a form of agency of weaker groups faced with a development intervention they do not agree with.","funding":"Flemish Interuniversity Council - University Development Co-operation (VLIR-UOS)","cited":44,"publisher":"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","year":2015,"volume":"9","issue":"2","pages":18},{"authors":"Vellingiri, Selvakumar; Dutta, Priya; Singh, Srishti; Sathish, L.

The causalities and ill impacts of the heat stress were higher among the slum dwellers because of the vulnerable household structures, which were made by heat-trapping materials like tin sheets, cement sheet (asbestos), plastic, and tarpaulin. The houses are not only dwellings but also a source of livelihood for many slum dwellers as they are involved in home-based work. The increase in the temperature of more than 40 degrees C severely affects health and increases energy expenditures. Objective: The present study conducted to identify the efficient cool roof technologies that reduce indoor temperature of the households and improve the heat resilience of dwellings located in the urban slums of Ahmedabad. Methodology: The performances of cool roof interventions were compared with the nonintervention - roof types, namely, tin, asbestos/cement sheet, and concrete. Relative humidity/temperature data loggers (Lascar EL-USB-2-LCD, Sweden) were used to measure the indoor ambient temperature and humidity. The questionnaire-based survey also has been conducted to understand the socioeconomic status and the perceptions related to roofing and health. Results: The results revealed that selected cool roof technologies including Thermocol insulation, solar reflective white paint on the outer surface of the roof, and Modroof are effectively reducing the indoor temperature as compared to the nonintervention roofing. Conclusion: Cool roof technologies have a wider scope as number of informal settlements are increasing across the cities in India and other developing countries. The governments may not able to provide proper housing to all these inhabitants due to various reasons including the land tenure of the habitats. Validated cool roof technologies can be promoted as these structures are not requires legal sanctions and easily dismantled and installed in multiple places and safeguards the investment of urban poor.","cited":17,"publisher":"WOLTERS KLUWER MEDKNOW PUBLICATIONS","year":2020,"volume":"24","issue":"1","pages":5},{"authors":"Rehman, Tanveer; Singh, Tarundeep; Sharma, Sugandhi; Kumar, Jitender; Govindan, Dhanajayan; Singh, Shubh Mohan","title":"Prevalence of Depression and Anxiety during the COVID-19 Pandemic among the Residents of an Urban Slum in North India","source":"JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCES IN RURAL PRACTICE","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"Objectives This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of depression and anxiety, and assess the knowledge, practice, and concerns regarding coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among the residents of an urban slum in Chandigarh, India.

The analysis suggests that political interventions have profoundly influenced the formation of perceived property rights among slum dwellers and their housing activities, though the underlying legal and political systems have motivated, enabled, and limited such informal arrangements.

Under this background, we aim to explore the women's perception of men's involvement in antenatal care (ANC), delivery and postnatal care (PNC) in the slum community of Bangladesh where various sexual and reproductive health problems exist. A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among women and their husbands living in 12 slums of Chattogram city. Cross-tabulation with chi-square tests and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to examine the predictors of husbands' support in wives' antenatal, delivery and postnatal care. The study demonstrates that the education and economic level of most women and their husbands were very low although husbands seemed to have a better status than wives in these aspects. Almost all men (similar to 90%) had never accessed services related to reproductive and maternal health. Only 10% of respondents gave birth to their last baby in government hospitals or private clinics. In addition, 60% of the husbands took care of their wives during pregnancy with 44% during childbirth and about 30% providing help in receiving postpartum care. Moreover, husbands' discussions with a health worker regarding maternal and reproductive health were the most important predictors for support of their wives during pregnancy, childbirth and postpartum care (p < 0.05). Study participants' perception of a satisfying spousal relationship also appeared to be a significant factor for husbands' responsible role regarding wives' antenatal care, delivery and postnatal care (p < 0.05). This study found that pregnant women living in slums received poorer health-related services when there was a low involvement of men; specifically, the husbands of pregnant women. In addition, men's involvement was influenced by many aspects, particularly awareness-related factors (e.g., knowledge, communication and access to reproductive health services). Therefore, awareness creation is important for active involvement in antenatal, delivery and postnatal care. Strategies should be designed to provide men living in the slums with adequate information, education and communication to gain their interest and support about reproductive and maternal health.","funding":"Research and Publication Office of the University of Chittagong [6753/2019]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71904171]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","cited":30,"publisher":"MDPI","year":2021,"volume":"9","issue":"4","pages":11},{"authors":"Vasconcelos de Freitas, Luiz Fernando","title":"PROFAVELA: CONQUESTS AND LIMITS OF THE SLUM MOVEMENT IN BELO HORIZONTE IN THE DEMOCRATIC TRANSITION IN THE 1980s","source":"REVISTA DE DIREITO DA CIDADE-CITY LAW","language":"Portuguese","doc":"Article","abstract":"The present article consists in the study of the approval of an urban development law in the 1980s, in the city of Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil, which recognized land rights to people who lives in slums and sought to insert them as part of the city.

These challenges stem from (1) the heavily-congested and unplanned nature of a slum, which results in a series of logistical challenges; and (2) the fact that slum dwellers reside in and around the upgrading project sites, which raises the level of resistance to project execution. As such, slum infrastructure upgrading projects face high risks of prolonged project duration and increased construction costs. This paper focuses on sanitary networks upgrading projects in slum areas. In these projects, the unplanned nature of the slum is manifested in the undocumented variations in road widths and their steep slopes as well as the ever changing urban characteristics of the area. It is common, under such conditions, for contractors to be forced to use different construction methods. Furthermore, these projects are expected to face high levels of dwellers' resistance because of the socioeconomic disturbance resulting from the construction activities. To address the aforementioned challenges, this paper proposes an automated heuristic-based planning model capable of prioritizing the upgrading phases and selecting the suitable construction methods to accelerate the delivery of service to slum dwellers. To this end, the model computes the rate of service delivery under different construction scenarios and hence accounts for the expected resistance in cases of late delivery. The model processes the urban characteristics of slum areas and topography data as well as the proposed sanitary network design in order to generate the optimal order of upgrading phases and the optimal selection of construction equipment. An application example is presented to demonstrate the use of the model and its capabilities.","cited":11,"publisher":"AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS","year":2016,"pages":9},{"authors":"Ibrahim, Mohamed R.; Haworth, James; Cheng, Tao","title":"URBAN-i: From urban scenes to mapping slums, transport modes, and pedestrians in cities using deep learning and computer vision","source":"ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING B-URBAN ANALYTICS AND CITY SCIENCE","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"In recent years, deep learning and computer vision have been applied to solve complex problems across many domains.

A large portion (around 2.2 million) of the population dwells in the slum areas under severe vulnerable conditions. Children residing in the slums are disproportionately affected with higher burden of undernutrition particularly stunting. In this paper, findings of a prospective cohort study which is part of a larger multi-country study are presented. Methods: Two hundred and sixty five children were enrolled and followed since their birth till 24 months of age. Anthropometric measurements, dietary intake and morbidity information were collected monthly. Data from 9 to 12, 1518 and 21-24 months were collated to analyze and report findings for 12, 18 and 24 months of age. Generalized estimating equation models were constructed to determine risk factors of stunting between 12 and 24 months of age. Result: Approximately, 18% of children were already stunted (LAZ < -2SD) at birth and the proportion increased to 48% at 24 months of age. Exclusive breastfeeding prevalence was only 9.4% following the WHO definition at 6 months. Dietary energy intake as well as intakes of carbohydrate, fat and protein were suboptimal for majority of the children. However, in regression analysis, LAZ at birth (AOR = 0.40, 95% CI: 0.26, 0.61), household with poor asset index (AOR = 2.81, 95% CI: 1.43, 5.52; ref.: average asset index), being male children (AOR = 1.75, 95% CI: 1.04, 2.95; ref.: female) and age (AOR = 2.34, 95% CI: 1.56, 3.52 at 24 months, AOR = 2.13, 95% CI: 1.55, 2.92 at 18 months; ref.: 12 months of age) were the significant predictors of stunting among this population. Conclusion: As the mechanism of stunting begins even before a child is born, strategies must be focused on life course approach and preventive measurement should be initiated during pregnancy. Alongside, government and policymakers have to develop sustainable strategies to improve various social and environmental factors those are closely interrelated with chronic undernutrition particularly concentrating on urban slum areas.","funding":"University of Virginia (UVA)","cited":87,"publisher":"BMC","year":2018,"volume":"18","pages":13},{"authors":"Nuijten, Monique; Koster, Martijn; de Vries, Pieter","title":"Regimes of spatial ordering in Brazil: Neoliberalism, leftist populism and modernist aesthetics in slum upgrading in Recife","source":"SINGAPORE JOURNAL OF TROPICAL GEOGRAPHY","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"This paper shows how regimes of spatial ordering in Brazil are produced by the entangling of neoliberalism, leftist populism and modernist visions. The paper focuses on Prometropole, a slum upgrading project in Recife funded by the World Bank, which commenced in 2007. In this project, the neoliberal dimension manifests in the idea that the state, private companies and citizens together are responsible for (re)constructing urban space, and further, that beneficiaries should behave as autonomous citizens, taking responsibility for their new living environment. The leftist political dimension is seen in participatory procedures to involve the target population from project design through to implementation, in expectation of their cooperation with the government. The modernist aesthetics of straight lines, open spaces and visible order informs the project design with the requirement to use the new houses and public spaces according to the standards of modern civilization. As our research shows, such a regime of spatial ordering clashes with the livelihoods of the urban poor, whose quality of life might even deteriorate as a result of the intervention. Furthermore, so-called participatory procedures fail to grant the target population any real influence in creating their environment. Consequently, these residents of the new housing estate drastically reconstruct their private and public areas, reappropriating the urban space and contesting the regime of spatial ordering imposed upon them.","cited":54,"publisher":"WILEY","year":2012,"volume":"33","issue":"2","pages":14},{"authors":"Sunita, Mohan; Desai, Shachi; Vinay, Prasad; Moolani, Samita; Rai, Navendu; Deepen, Sheth; Ashwini, Rogiye; Manish, Sonawane; Hemangi, Gawali; Abdal, Oliullah; Kulkarni, Pandurang; Chakravarti, Arindam; Uthra, Satagopan; Raman, Rajiv; Radhika, Srinivasan; Natarajan, Sundaram; Kumaramanickavel, Govindasamy; McCarty, Catherine","title":"Aditya Jyot-Diabetic Retinopathy in Urban Mumbai Slums Study (AJ-DRUMSS): Study Design and Methodology - Report 1","source":"OPHTHALMIC EPIDEMIOLOGY","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"Purpose: To describe the methodology of Aditya Jyot-Diabetic Retinopathy in Urban Mumbai Slums Study (AJ-DRUMSS), which was designed (i) to estimate the prevalence of diabetic retinopathy (DR) in a general population, (ii) to study the risk factors associated with DR in those with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), and (iii) to create awareness for early detection and develop timely interventional management for DR. Methods: AJ-DRUMSS is an ongoing population-based cross sectional study conducted in seven wards of slums in Mumbai, India, wherein eligible subjects from the general population were screened for DR and profiled for their demographic, social and biochemical parameters to study the associations of these factors. Results: To date, nearly 54,000 households have been enumerated for both awareness and DR prevalence in five study areas (out of seven) during 17 awareness campaigns and 78 DR screening camps. Of these, 4295 households were included in AJ-DRUMSS.

The Favela Bairro slum upgrading program (FBP), which seeks to transform favelas into formal neighbourhoods, is seen as a complex and appropriate solution to Rio's housing woes. The paper specifically focuses on land tenure challenges in Rio and the way the FBP dealt with this issue. The FBP is noteworthy as an example of slum upgrading without full land tenure legalization and for its use of state of exception, primarily the concession of right to use but not full ownership of land in order to allow this program to take place. This placed greater emphasis on infrastructural and living condition improvement rather than legalization of land tenure. As a result, the implementation of FBP has had the effect of increasing the security of tenure of favela residents. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Infection with pathogenic Leptospira occurs during environmental exposures and is traditionally associated with occupational risk activities. However, slum inhabitants reside in close proximity to environmental sources of contamination, suggesting that transmission during urban epidemics occurs in the household environment. Methods and Findings: A survey was performed to determine whether Leptospira infection clustered within households located in slum communities in the city of Salvador, Brazil. Hospital-based surveillance identified 89 confirmed cases of leptospirosis during an outbreak. Serum samples were obtained from members of 22 households with index cases of leptospirosis and 52 control households located in the same slum communities. The presence of anti-Leptospira agglutinating antibodies was used as a marker for previous infection. In households with index cases, 22 (30%) of 74 members had anti-Leptospira antibodies, whereas 16 (8%) of 195 members from control households had anti-Leptospira antibodies. Highest titres were directed against L. interrogans serovars of the Icterohaemorrhagiae serogroup in 95% and 100% of the subjects with agglutinating antibodies from case and control households, respectively. Residence in a household with an index case of leptospirosis was associated with increased risk (OR 5.29, 95% CI 2.13-13.12) of having had a Leptospira infection. Increased infection risk was found for all age groups who resided in a household with an index case, including children <15 years of age (P = 0.008). Conclusions: This study identified significant household clustering of Leptospira infection in slum communities where recurrent epidemics of leptospirosis occur. The findings support the hypothesis that the household environment is an important transmission determinant in the urban slum setting. Prevention therefore needs to target sources of contamination and risk activities which occur in the places where slum inhabitants reside.","funding":"Brazilian National Research CouncilConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ) [300.861/1996, 554.788/2006]; National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [AI052473, TW00919]; FOGARTY INTERNATIONAL CENTERUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Fogarty International Center (FIC) [D43TW000919] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [R01AI052473] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","cited":34,"publisher":"PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE","year":2008,"volume":"2","issue":"1","pages":6},{"authors":"MOITRA, MK","title":"ENVIRONMENTAL IMPROVEMENT OF SLUMS - THE CALCUTTA EXPERIENCE","source":"BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"India, strangely, has few metropolitan cities, considering its geographical area and the huge hinterland these cities support. Calcutta, the largest metropolis in India and one of the largest in the world, owes its origin to being the capital of the British colonial government for more than a century until the administration shifted to Delhi in the early part of this century. Calcutta, therefore, represents the positive and negative aspects of the colonial metropolishes that litter a large part of the developing world. Due to various reasons brought out in this paper, the city's infrasturcture is at its lowest threshold of performance. This, coupled with slums, as old as the city itself, calls for an extremely careful and considered approach to upgrade the quality of life. Selected papers on slum problems of the largest metropolitan cities of India that follow this one bring out various areas or urban contradictions facing present day planners. The Calcutta example is the most novel of these experiments, primarily due to the fact that planners here have considered that slums are not only a reality, they are an inseparable component of the city system. This approach is contrary to many metropolitan cities, where cosmetic improvement takes precedence over absorption and realizes that the pockets of blemishes are a normal texture of the cityscape. The author has in this paper emphasized the need for a human and practical approach to upgrade quality of life in this city which has yielded slow but extremely significant improvement measurable in quantitative terms.","cited":0,"publisher":"PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD","year":1991,"volume":"26","issue":"3","pages":5},{"authors":"Beguy, Donatien; Ezeh, Alex C.; Mberu, Blessing U.; Emina, Jacques B.

Understanding these drivers become even more necessary in impoverished areas where occupants struggle to avail essential energy services. The literature indicates that energy injustice can be addressed through provisioning of comfort, cleanliness, and convenience (3Cs) as critical cultural energy services in low-income areas. This study investigates the socio-architectural influence for slum rehabilitation housing (SRH) on cultural energy services that can promote distributive justice. The methodology adopts an empirical route using data from 200 household surveys from SRH in Mumbai, India, and Joao Pessoa, Brazil. A model between the 3Cs and socio-architectural elements was established using Firth's binary logistic regression. The survey results showed that the SRH in Brazil had twice the appliance ownership as compared to the Mumbai SRH. There were distinct energy service preferences in the study areas, despite common poverty burdens. The empirical results showed that the lack of socio-architectural design elements like open spaces, privacy, and walkability in the study areas demanded specific comfort and convenience appliances as a counter-response. A critical policy implication drawn was on the need for socio-architectural inclusive energy planning for distributive justice in poverty. Mitigating rising energy demand through appropriate built environment design of slum rehabilitation housing can contribute to fulfilling the UN's SDG 7 (clean and affordable energy) and 11 (sustainable cities and communities) goals.","funding":"Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, through the Gates Cambridge Scholarship [OPP1144]; Trinity College MCSC Scholarship; Santander Mobility Grant; Ministry of Human Resource Development, the Government of India (GoI) project titled CoE-FAST [14MHRD005]; IRCC-IIT Bombay Fund [16IRCC561015]; Bill and Melinda Gates FoundationBill & Melinda Gates Foundation","cited":82,"publisher":"MDPI","year":2020,"volume":"12","issue":"7","pages":27},{"authors":"Ushijima, Ken; Irie, Mitsuteru; Sintawardani, Neni; Triastuti, Jovita; Hamidah, Umi; Ishikawa, Tadaharu; Funamizu, Naoyuki","title":"Sustainable design of sanitation system based on material and value flow analysis for urban slum in Indonesia","source":"FRONTIERS OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & ENGINEERING","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"Material flow analysis (MFA) and value flow analysis (VFA) were applied to the sanitation system in an urban slum in Indonesia.

It was not able to make proper use of the opportunity to create awareness on nutrition issues, change norms and practices, and persuade mothers/families to make positive behavior change. IPC was not effective, as it was not personalized as per patient's educational level and ability to understand technical information. Though IPC component was better for immunization services, it was weakest for nutrition in case of children younger than 2y. ICDS program implementation lays more emphasis on food supplementation than on nutrition and health education interventions. Thus, role of IPC should be increased manifold to inculcate appropriate feeding practices among mothers to improve nutrition in these children. Health and nutrition messages need to reach every household repeatedly through multiple complementary sources to bring desired behavior-change in the community.","cited":18,"publisher":"SPRINGER INDIA","year":2013,"volume":"80","issue":"12","pages":6},{"authors":"Burra, S","title":"Towards a pro-poor framework for slum upgrading in Mumbai, India","source":"ENVIRONMENT AND URBANIZATION","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"This paper examines the institutional framework and financial mechanisms for slum upgrading in Mumbai, including the use of Transferable Development Rights (TDR), and assesses their strengths and limitations.

Sixty-seven children at the St. George primary school in Kibera participated in the school feeding programme for 1 year and data concerning anaemia rate, nutritional status and socioeconomic status were collected during a medical health check. Data were compared with a control group of children attending the same school, of the same age and with the same gender distribution without participation in a feeding programme. Data were analyzed with statistical software (SPSS 17.0). Children participating in the school feeding programme were less stunted (p = 0.02) and wasted (p = 0.02) than children in the control group, and levels of anaemia were lower (p = 0.01). Having no father (p = 0.01) and living in small families (p = 0.003) overruled the effect of the feeding programme. Also, the higher the mother's education, the more wasting was seen (p = 0.04) despite participation in the programme. The programme reduced anaemia and malnutrition and has improved child growth in our study group greatly, but we found that education level of the mother, family size and absence of a father overruled the effect of the school feeding programme.

In a household-based survey conducted by the African Population and Health Research Center (APHRC), 4 767 men and women aged between 15 and 54 years were randomly sampled from two slums (Korogocho and Viwandani) in Nairobi and data were collected on the social and health context of HIV and AIDS in these settlements.

The proportion of respondents that had ever been tested and knew their HIV status was 53%, with the women having greater awareness of their HIV status (62%) than the men (38%). Awareness of HIV status was significantly associated with age, sex, level of education, marital status and slum of residence. The lower level of HIV-status awareness among the men compared with the women in the slums suggests a poor uptake of HIV-testing services by males. Innovative strategies are needed to ensure greater access and uptake of HIV-testing services by the younger and less-educated residents of these slums if the barriers to HIV-status awareness are to be overcome.","funding":"Rockefeller Foundation [2006AR013]","cited":40,"publisher":"NATL INQUIRY SERVICES CENTRE PTY LTD","year":2012,"volume":"11","issue":"4","pages":6},{"authors":"Muindi, Kanyiva; Egondi, Thaddaeus; Kimani-Murage, Elizabeth; Rocklov, Joacim; Ng, Nawi","title":"We are used to this: a qualitative assessment of the perceptions of and attitudes towards air pollution amongst slum residents in Nairobi","source":"BMC PUBLIC HEALTH","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"Background: People's perceptions of and attitudes towards pollution are critical for reducing exposure among people and can also influence the response to interventions that are aimed at encouraging behaviour change.

Results: The discussions revealed that the two communities experience air pollution arising mainly from industries and dump sites. There was an apparent disconnect between knowledge and practice, with individuals engaging in practices that placed them at high risk of exposure to air pollution. Residents appear to have rationalized the situation in which they live in and were resigned to these conditions. Consequently, they expressed lack of agency in addressing prevalent air pollution within their communities. Conclusions: Community-wide education on air pollution and related health effects together with the measures needed to reduce exposure to air pollution are necessary towards reducing air pollution impacts.

MethodsWe used data from a cross-sectional population-based survey, conducted in 2008-2009, involving a random sample of 5190 (2794 men and 2396 women) adults aged 18years living in two slums - Korogocho and Viwandani - in Nairobi. ResultsThe prevalence (weighted by sampling and response rates) of diabetes was 4.8% (95%CI 4.0-5.7) in women and 4.0% (95%CI 3.3-4.7) in men. Less than a quarter of those found to have diabetes were aware of their condition among which just over half of men and three-quarters of women reported being on any treatment in the 12months preceding the survey. Overall, fewer than 5% of all people with diabetes had their blood sugar under control. Obesity and overweight were significantly associated with increased odds (1.7, 95%CI 1.1-2.6) of raised blood glucose only among women while adjusting for important covariates. ConclusionThe prevalence of diabetes in this impoverished population is moderately high, while the levels of awareness, treatment and control are quite low. In this population, obesity is an important risk factor for raised blood glucose particularly among women. Prevention and control strategies that target modifiable risk factors for diabetes and increase access to treatment and control in such disadvantaged settings are urgently needed.","funding":"Wellcome Trust UKWellcome Trust","cited":39,"publisher":"WILEY","year":2013,"volume":"18","issue":"12","pages":11},{"authors":"Agestika, Lina; Sintawardani, Neni; Hamidah, Umi; Nyambe, Sikopo; Yamauchi, Taro","title":"Pattern of child faeces management and disposable diaper usage among under-fives in an Urban Slum of Bandung, Indonesia","source":"JOURNAL OF WATER SANITATION AND HYGIENE FOR DEVELOPMENT","language":"English","doc":"Article; Early Access","abstract":"Children's faecal waste is a major environmental health issue despite increasing access to sanitation facilities and sanitary products in Indonesia.

This paper examines the determinants associated with participation in the NHIF among residents of urban slums in Nairobi city. Methods: The study used data from the Nairobi Urban Health and Demographic Surveillance System in two slums in Nairobi city, where a total of about 60,000 individuals living in approximately 23,000 households are under surveillance. Descriptive statistics and multivariate logistic regression analysis were used to describe the characteristics of the sample and to identify factors associated with participation in the NHIF program. Results: Only 10% of the respondents were participating in the NHIF program, while less than 1% (0.8%) had private insurance coverage. The majority of the respondents (89%) did not have any type of insurance coverage. Females were more likely to participate in the NHIF program (OR = 2.4; p < 0.001), while respondents who were formerly in a union (OR = 0.5; p < 0.05) and who were never in a union (OR = 0.6; p < 0.05) were less likely to have public insurance coverage. Respondents working in the formal employment sector (OR = 4.1; p < 0.001) were more likely to be enrolled in the NHIF program compared to those in the informal sector. Membership in microfinance institutions such as savings and credit cooperative organizations (SACCOs) and community-based savings and credit groups were important determinants of access to health insurance. Conclusions: The proportion of slum residents without any type of insurance is high, which underscores the need for a social health insurance program to ensure equitable access to health care among the poor and vulnerable segments of the population. As the Kenyan government moves toward transforming the NHIF into a universal health program, it is important to harness the unique opportunities offered by both the formal and informal microfinance institutions in improving health care capacity by considering them as viable financing options within a comprehensive national health financing policy framework.","funding":"Wellcome TrustWellcome TrustEuropean Commission [GR 07830 M]; William and Flora Hewlett Foundation [2006-8376]; Rockefeller Foundation [2007-HE 008]","cited":51,"publisher":"BIOMED CENTRAL LTD","year":2012,"volume":"12","pages":11},{"authors":"Swahn, Monica H.; Dill, LeConte J.; Palmier, Jane B.; Kasirye, Rogers","title":"Girls and Young Women Living in the Slums of Kampala: Prevalence and Correlates of Physical and Sexual Violence Victimization","source":"SAGE OPEN","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"This study determined the prevalence and correlates of victimization among girls and young women in Kampala.

Cluster analysis was used to aggregate households into livelihood groups. Setting: Dhaka slums, Bangladesh. Subjects: Five-hundred and fifty-nine households. Main outcome measures: Socio-economic and demographic variables, nutritional status, morbidity. Results: Four livelihood groups were identified. Cluster 1 (n = 178) was the richest cluster with land, animals, business assets and savings. Loans as well as income were higher, which shows that this group was credit-worthy. The group was mainly self-employed and worked more days per month than the other clusters. The cluster had the second highest body mass index (BMI) score, and the highest children's nutrition status.

Although mental health problems (e.g. depression) in developing countries are highly prevalent, such issues are not yet adequately addressed in the rapidly urbanising megacities of these countries, where a growing number of residents live in slums. Little is known about the spectrum of mental well-being in urban slums and only poor knowledge exists on health promotive socio-physical environments in these areas. Using a geo-epidemiological approach, the present study identified factors that contribute to the mental well-being in the slums of Dhaka, which currently accommodates an estimated population of more than 14 million, including 3.4 million slum dwellers. Methods: The baseline data of a cohort study conducted in early 2009 in nine slums of Dhaka were used. Data were collected from 1,938 adults (>= 15 years). All respondents were geographically marked based on their households using global positioning systems (GPS). Very high-resolution land cover information was processed in a Geographic Information System (GIS) to obtain additional exposure information. We used a factor analysis to reduce the socio-physical explanatory variables to a fewer set of uncorrelated linear combinations of variables. We then regressed these factors on the WHO-5 Well-being Index that was used as a proxy for self-rated mental wellbeing. Results: Mental well-being was significantly associated with various factors such as selected features of the natural environment, flood risk, sanitation, housing quality, sufficiency and durability. We further identified associations with population density, job satisfaction, and income generation while controlling for individual factors such as age, gender, and diseases. Conclusions: Factors determining mental well-being were related to the socio-physical environment and individual level characteristics. Given that mental well-being is associated with physiological well-being, our study may provide crucial information for developing better health care and disease prevention programmes in slums of Dhaka and other comparable settings.","funding":"German Research Foundation (DFG)German Research Foundation (DFG) [HO 2568/5-2]","cited":62,"publisher":"BMC","year":2012,"volume":"12","pages":14},{"authors":"Clarke, Colin","title":"From slum to ghetto - Social deprivation in Kingston, Jamaica","source":"INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT PLANNING REVIEW","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"Massive population growth in the cities of the developing world since 1950 has given rise to high-density, inner-city slums and, since the 1960s, to the expansion of informal, usually squatted, settlements on the periphery of the original built-up area. The experience of Kingston, Jamaica, has been at odds with this generalisation, largely because of the absence of massive squatter developments, and the concentration of population in rental accommodation or in makeshift housing located on rented land near the city centre. As early as the late 1930s, the West India Royal Commission commented adversely on poor-quality housing and dense populations in Kingston, associated with multi-occupied tenements and rent yards. This paper traces the evolution of the rented, late colonial slum into the post-independence (1962) Kingston ghetto. The change in nomenclature is associated with the violence of the ghetto since political competition become endemic in the 1970s: in short, the slum (by analogy with the US urban ghettos) become a no-go area. Nevertheless, the ghetto can still be defined, using 1991 census materials, on the basis of essentially the some conditions as those revealed by the 1960 census. At both dates multiple deprivation was conditioned by low-class status, black face, and by high and persistent rates of rental and unemployment.

A convenience sampling approach was employed in selecting 38 slums from 675 un-notified slums across four geographic zones. Ten percent of the households in each slum site were selected from each zone, and one household member was interviewed, based on their availability and fulfilment of the eligibility criteria. Eligible individuals included those aged 18 years and above, who were resident in the selected slums and provided consent. Individuals with mental or physical challenges were excluded. A total sample of 907 study participants were included. Results showed that 43% (n = 393) of the participants were food insecure. More than half were females (73%, n = 285), who had not completed any schooling (51%, n = 202). One-third (n = 128) resided in the Northern Region of Delhi. SDG-related predictors of food insecurity included: household educational level (SDG 4 Quality education) (p = 0.03), coverage of health service needs (SDG 3 Good health and well-being) (p = 0.0002), electricity needs (SDG 7 affordable and clean energy) (p<0.0001), and employment needs (SDG 8 Decent and economic growth) (p = 0.003). Having healthcare needs that were partially or fully met was equally associated with higher food insecurity: this could be attributed to high healthcare costs and the lack of federal subsidies in un-notified slums, collectively contributing to high out-of-pocket health costs. Failure to fully meet employment needs was also significantly associated with higher food insecurity. However, met needs for electricity, finance, women's safety and satisfactory family relationships, were associated with lower food insecurity. Household predictors of food insecurity included: number of household members, and the presence of physically disabled household members. Necessary interventions should include connecting food insecure households to existing social services such as India's Public Distribution System, and multi-sector partnerships to address the existing challenges.","cited":29,"publisher":"PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE","year":2019,"volume":"14","issue":"4","pages":24},{"authors":"Shermin, Nishat; Rahaman, Sk Nafiz","title":"Assessment of sanitation service gap in urban slums for tackling COVID-19","source":"JOURNAL OF URBAN MANAGEMENT","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been declared as a global pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). As the disease is highly infectious, the Global South countries are in a vulnerable situation with high urban population density and lack of Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH) services. The situation for the urban slum dwellers and low-income group clusters are becoming worse. Lack of health and sanitation service availability has already been an issue for them before the beginning of the pandemic. So, it is predictable that adopting this massive global pandemic is a critical challenge for them. This paper assesses the sanitation service gap in urban slums, which has become a severe challenge to tackle due to COVID-19. The study areas of this research are the Ranarmath slum and the Khema slum of Khulna city, Bangladesh. The SERVQUAL model has been used to identify the quality of sanitation service available in these informal residential settlements. The interpretation of questionnaire survey data from the two slums reveals that one slum lacks Assurance and Empathy, where the other slum lacks Tangibility and Responsiveness. However, the Tangibility, Reliability, and Responsiveness condition of both slums are flawed with the lack of latrine functionalities and services from concerned authorities. The incompatibility of the condi-tion has been identified by evaluating the WHO's different sanitation management policy for COVID-19. The research concludes that sanitation services like handwashing facilities and water supply availability in the latrine directly related to COVID-19 prevention are indigent for these slums.","cited":55,"publisher":"ELSEVIER","year":2021,"volume":"10","issue":"3","pages":12},{"authors":"Bhilwar, Meenakshi; Lal, Panna; Sharma, Nandini; Bhalla, Preena; Kumar, Ashok","title":"Prevalence of induced abortions and contraceptive use among married women in an urban slum of Delhi, India","source":"INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGY & OBSTETRICS","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"Objective: To document abortion practices and contraceptive use among women of reproductive age in an urban slum of Delhi.

The practice of CBE commonly known as false teeth removal continues to be an adopted cultural intervention of choice, in the prevention of morbidity and mortality from common childhood illnesses. However, it is a practice against the rights of the children with serious consequences. While CBE is associated with the perceived myth of curative gains, the agony emanating from the cultural practice exposes children to ill-health conditions such as dehydration, malnutrition, blood-borne diseases like HIV/AIDS, septicemia, fever and death. This research sought to understand the factors underpinning the practice of CBE among urban slum dwellers. Method: A cross-sectional study was conducted from five randomly selected slums in Makindye division; 298 household heads or guardians with children below 5 years, who had ever suffered from false teeth were interviewed. The variables measured included guardians' socio-demographic profiles, determinants of CBE, common childhood illnesses assumed to be treated with CBE and the reported side-effects associated with the practice. Results: Of the 298 respondents with children who had ever suffered from false teeth interviewed, 56.7% had two or more children below 5 years and 31.9% were from the central region. The proportion of households practicing CBE was 903%; 69.8% of the caretakers mentioned that it was done by traditional healers and for 12.1% by trained health workers (dentists). Number of children (OR = 2.8, 95% CI: 1.1-7.2) and the belief that CBE is bad (OR = 0.1, 95% CI: < 0.001, p < 0.001) had a statistically significant association with CBE. Additionally, number of children (X-2 = 4.9, p = 0.027) and 2 sets of beliefs (CBE treats diarrhea (X-2 = 12.8, p = 0.0017) and CBE treats fever (X-2 = 15.1, p = 0.0005) were independent predictors of CBE practice. A total of 55.7% respondents knew that there were side effects to CBE and 31% mentioned death as one of them. Conclusion: The high proportion of households practicing CBE from this study ought to awaken the perception that the practice is ancient CBE in this community as the study suggests was strongly driven by myths. The strong belief that CBE is bad provides an opportunity for concerted effort by primary health care providers, policy makers and the community to demystify the myths associated with false teeth and the gains of CBE.","cited":20,"publisher":"BMC","year":2018,"volume":"18","pages":8},{"authors":"Sendo, Endalew G.; Chauke, Motshedisi E.; Ganga-Limando, M.","title":"Women's perspectives on the measures that need to be taken to increase the use of health-care facility delivery service among slums women, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia: a qualitative study","source":"REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"Background Global strategies to target high maternal mortality ratios are focused on providing skilled attendance at delivery along with access to emergency obstetric care. Research that examines strategies to increase facility-based skilled birth attendance among slum residents in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, is limited. Objective The study aimed to explore women's perspectives on the measures that need to be taken to increase the use of the facility-delivery service among slums women, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia Methods Qualitative exploratory and descriptive research designs were used. Participants in the study were women in the reproductive age group (18-49 years of age) living in the slum areas of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. A purposive sampling strategy was used to select study participants. Potential participants' names were gathered from health facilities and followed to their homes for the study. Four audio-recorded focus group discussions [FGDs] were conducted with 32 participants from the three public health centers and one district hospital. The number of participants in FGDs was between 6 and 10 women. Data were analyzed simultaneously with data collection. Thematic analysis was used in data analysis, which entails three interconnected stages: data reduction, data display, and data conclusion. In addition, thematic analysis entailed evaluating the structure and content of textual data, identifying data themes, coding the themes, and then interpreting the structure and content of the themes. A codebook was first devised, discussed, and adopted by the writers before they could use this technique. Using the codebook, the theme codes were then manually produced. To explain the study results, verbatim excerpts from participants were given. The researcher used Techs' eight steps of qualitative data analysis method for analyzing the data. A multi-level life-course framework of facility-based delivery in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) developed by Bohren et al. was used to frame the current study and link the findings of the study to the body of knowledge. Results The FGDs included a total of 32 participants. The mean age of the overall sample was 32.6 years (+/- SD = 5.2). Participants' educational characteristics indicate that the majority (24 out of 32) was found to have no formal education, and two-thirds of participants were found to have one to five children. Three-fourths of them attended the ANC twice and they all gave birth to their last child at home. Two themes emerged from the analysis of focus group data, namely provision of quality, respectful and dignified midwifery care, and lack of awareness about facility delivery. These themes were described as a rich and comprehensive account of the views and suggestions made by focused antenatal care [FANC] participants on measures required to improve the use of the facility-delivery services. The findings of the study raise concerns about the effectiveness of FANC in encouraging facility-deliveries since FANC participants had not used health facilities for their last childbirth. According to the findings of the focus groups, women who took part in this study identified measures required to increase the use of health facility-delivery services among FANC participants in Addis Ababa's slum residents. It is to be expected that diligent counseling during antenatal care about birth plans would facilitate prompt arrival at facilities consistent with the desires of women. Plain language summary Global strategies for targeting high maternal mortality levels are based on ensuring eligible delivery attendance along with access to obstetric emergency care. Research examining strategies to increase facility-based skilled birth attendance among slum residents in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, is minimal. The study aimed to examine women's perspectives on measures needed to improve the use of health facility-based delivery services.

BRAC is the largest non-governmental organisation in Bangladesh. BRAC has been working to reduce maternal, neonatal and under-five children morbidity and mortality of slum dwellers in cities. BRAC has been doing this work for a decade through a programme called MANOSHI. This programme provides door-to-door services to its beneficiaries through community health workers (CHWs) and normal delivery service through its delivery and maternity centres. BRAC started the 'MANOSHI' programme in Narayanganj City Corporation during 2011 to address maternal, neonatal and child health problems facing slum dwellers. We investigated the existing maternal health-service indicators in the slums of Narayanganj City Corporation and compared the findings with a non-intervention area. Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted during 2012, in 47 slums of Narayanganj City Corporation as intervention and 10 slums of Narsingdi Sadar Municipality as comparison area. A total of 1206 married women, aged 15-49 years, with a pregnancy outcome in the previous year were included for interview. Data on socio-demographic characteristics, reproductive and maternal health-care practices like use of contraceptive methods, antenatal care (ANC), delivery care, postnatal care (PNC) were collected through a structured questionnaire. The chi-square test, Student t test, Mann Whitney U-test, factor analysis and log-binominal test were performed by using STATA statistical software for analysing data. Results The activities of BRAC CHWs significantly improved four or more ANC (47% vs. 21%; p< 0.000) and PNC (48% vs. 39%; p< 0.01) coverage in the intervention slums compared to comparison slums. Still, about half of the deliveries in both areas were attended at home by unskilled birth attendants, of which a very few received PNC within 48 hours after delivery. The poorest and illiterate women received fewer maternal health services from medically trained providers (MTPs). The poorest had a lower likelihood of receiving services from MTPs during delivery complications. Conclusion The MANOSHI programme service coverage for delivery care and PNC-checkup for women who prefer home delivery needs to be improved. For sustainable improvement of maternal health outcomes in urban slums, the programme needs to facilitate access to services for poor and illiterate women.","funding":"BRAC","cited":60,"publisher":"PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE","year":2016,"volume":"11","issue":"10","pages":19},{"authors":"Das, Priyanka; Khatun, Argina; Bose, Kaushik; Chakraborty, Raja","title":"The validity of mid-upper arm circumference as an indicator of low BMI in population screening for undernutrition: a study among adult slum dwellers in eastern India","source":"PUBLIC HEALTH NUTRITION","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"Objective: To explore the possibility for a statistically appropriate value of mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) to identify the state of severe undernutrition, based on very low BMI, among adult Indian slum dwellers.

Settings and Designs: This cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted in the slums of Burdwan Municipality in 2019. Methods and Material: A total of 330 households were selected by cluster sampling. Salt iodine content was estimated at household level semi-quantitatively by Iodine testing kit, following recommended guidelines. One respondent from each household was interviewed to assess their awareness and practice regarding iodized salt.

In India, more than 50% of the total cases were documented in megacities and million-plus cities. The slums of cities are the most vulnerable due to its unhygienic environment and high population density that requires an urgent implementation of public healthcare measures. This study aims to examine habitat vulnerability in slum areas to COVID-19 in India using principal component analysis and Fuzzy AHP based technique to develop slum vulnerability index to COVID-19 (SVIcovid-19). Four slum vulnerability groups (i.e. principal components) were retained with eigen-values greater than 1 based on Kaiser criterion-poor slum household status; lack of social distance maintenance; high concentrations of slum population and towns and mobility of the households. This study also mapped composite SVIcovid-19 on the basis of PCA and Fuzzy AHP method at the state level for a better understanding of spatial variations. The result shows that slums located in the eastern and central parts of India (particularly Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha, West Bengal) were more vulnerable to COVID-19 transmission due to lack of availability as well as accessibility to the basic services and amenities to slum dwellers. Thus, the findings of the study may not only help to understand the habitat vulnerability in slum areas to COVID-19 but it will also teach a lesson to implement effective policies for enhancing the quality of slum households (HHs) and to reduce the health risk from any infectious disease in future.","cited":79,"publisher":"ELSEVIER","year":2021,"volume":"65","pages":16},{"authors":"Kimani-Murage, Elizabeth W.; Kyobutungi, Catherine; Ezeh, Alex C.; Wekesah, Frederick; Wanjohi, Milka; Muriuki, Peterrock; Musoke, Rachel N.; Norris, Shane A.; Griffiths, Paula; Madise, Nyovani J.","title":"Effectiveness of personalised, home-based nutritional counselling on infant feeding practices, morbidity and nutritional outcomes among infants in Nairobi slums: study protocol for a cluster randomised controlled trial","source":"TRIALS","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"Background: Nutrition in the first 1,000 days of life (during pregnancy and the first two years) is critical for child growth and survival. Poor maternal, infant and young child nutrition (MIYCN) practices are widely documented in Kenya, with potential detrimental effects on child growth and survival. This is particularly a problem in slums, where most urban residents live. For example, exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months is only about two per cent. Innovative strategies to reach slum residents are therefore needed. Strategies like the Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative have proven effective in some settings but their effectiveness in resource-limited settings, including slums where many women do not deliver in hospital, is questionable. We propose to test the effectiveness of a home-based intervention on infant feeding practices, nutrition and health outcomes of infants born in two slums in Nairobi, Kenya. Methods/Design: The study, employing a cluster-randomised study design, will be conducted in two slums in Nairobi: Korogocho and Viwandani where 14 community units (defined by the Government's health care system) will form the unit of randomization. A total of 780 pregnant women and their respective child will be recruited into the study. The mother-child pair will be followed up until the child is one year old. Recruitment will last approximately one year and three months from September 2012 to December 2013. The mothers will receive regular, personalised, home-based counselling by trained Community Health Workers on MIYCN. Regular assessment of knowledge, attitudes and practices on MIYCN will be done, coupled with assessments of nutritional status of the mother-child pairs and diarrhea morbidity for the children. Statistical methods will include analysis of covariance and multinomial logistic regression. Additionally, cost-effectiveness analysis will be done. The study is funded by the Wellcome Trust and will run from March 2012 to February 2015. Discussion: Interventions aimed at promoting optimal breastfeeding and complementary feeding practices are considered to have high impact and could prevent a fifth of the under-five deaths in countries with high mortality rates. This study will inform policy and practice in Kenya and similar settings regarding delivery mechanisms for such high-impact interventions, particularly among urban poor populations.","funding":"Wellcome TrustWellcome TrustEuropean Commission [097146/Z/11/Z]; William and Flora Hewlett Foundation; Swedish International Cooperation Agency (SIDA); Bill and Melinda Gates FoundationBill & Melinda Gates Foundation; British Academy mid-career fellowship [MD120048]; Medical Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)European Commission [G1001333] Funding Source: researchfish; MRCUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC) [G1001333] Funding Source: UKRI","cited":56,"publisher":"BMC","year":2013,"volume":"14","pages":11},{"authors":"Sengupta, C","title":"Dynamics of community environmental management in Howrah slums","source":"ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL WEEKLY","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"Howrah's slum communities have demonstrated a limited knack for managing their environment.

RESULTS: out of 400 respondents, 71.8% were females and 28% were males, 32.8% were educated till primary and 58% belonged to lower middle socio-economic status. Awareness regarding malaria, dengue, JE was poor compared to chikungunya (60% aware). Rainy season was rightly quoted as the season for MBD's, 96% didn't knew about breeding places of mosquito and 49.8% were unaware of the mode of transmission. Friends/relatives were the most common source of information. The use of personal protective measures was seen in less than 50% of the respondents and 96.3% of them used only at night. The community measures undertaken in that area to prevent MBD's was minimal and consisted of only insecticide fogging (44%). CONCLUSION: A significant number were unaware of MBD's, the natural outbreak of chikungunya provided the much needed information of the disease at the place. Strengthening personal protective and community measures to prevent MBD's is the need of the hour.","cited":10,"publisher":"JOURNAL EVOLUTION MEDICAL & DENTAL SCIENCES","year":2015,"volume":"4","issue":"18","pages":8},{"authors":"Marwasta, Djaka; Rahayu, Theresia D.

Developmental delay is said to occur when a child fails to reach the age-appropriate anticipated milestones. This imparts long-term direct as well as indirect effects on the health of a community obviating routine measurement of its prevalence especially in high-risk populations. Aim: To find out the prevalence and correlates of developmental delay among children under two years of age in slums of Burdwan Municipality, West Bengal. Settings and Design: A community-based descriptive cross-sectional study. Methods and Materials: This study was conducted between September-November 2019 among 240 study subjects selected by multistage simple random sampling. Data were collected by interviewing the respondents using a predesigned, pretested schedule. Developmental status was assessed by applying Trivandrum Developmental Screening Chart (TDSC). Chi-square test and logistic regression was done to find associations. Results: Prevalence of developmental delay was 6.6%(95%CI 3.6-9.8) and proportion was more among male infants. Chi square test revealed gender (p = 0.03), mothers' education (p = 0.00), socio-economic status (p = 0.00), parity (p = 0.02), birth spacing (p = 0.01) birth weight (p = 0.00) to be significantly associated with developmental delay and multivariable analysis showed all the factors to be significant predictors except gender, parity and birth spacing. Gestational duration, maternal age at delivery, mode of delivery was not found to be significantly associated with developmental delay.

However, there is a dearth of information on the population-level implications of slum life for human health. This manuscript describes the 2005 Census and Mapping of Slums (CMS), which used geographic information systems (GIS) tools and digital satellite imagery combined with more traditional fieldwork methodologies, to obtain detailed, up-to-date and new information about slum life in all slums of six major cities in Bangladesh (including Dhaka). Results: The CMS found that Bangladeshi slums are very diverse: there are wide intra- and intercity variations in population size, density, the percent of urban populations living in slums, and sanitation conditions. Findings also show that common beliefs about slums may be outdated; of note, tenure insecurity was found to be an issue in only a small minority of slums. Conclusion: The methodology used in the 2005 Bangladesh CMS provides a useful approach to mapping slums that could be applied to urban areas in other low income societies. This methodology may become an increasingly important analytic tool to inform policy, as cities in developing countries are forecasted to continue increasing their share of total global population in the coming years, with slum populations more than doubling in size during the same period.","cited":20,"publisher":"BMC","year":2009,"volume":"8","pages":19},{"authors":"Ziraba, Abdhalah Kasiira; Kyobutungi, Catherine; Zulu, Eliya Msiyaphazi","title":"Fatal Injuries in the Slums of Nairobi and their Risk Factors: Results from a Matched Case-Control Study","source":"JOURNAL OF URBAN HEALTH-BULLETIN OF THE NEW YORK ACADEMY OF MEDICINE","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"Injuries contribute significantly to the rising morbidity and mortality attributable to non-communicable diseases in the developing world.

The causes of death are determined using verbal autopsies. We used a nested case-control study design with all deaths from injuries between 2003 and 2005 as cases. Two controls were randomly selected from the non-injury deaths over the same period and individually matched to each case on age and sex.

Intentional injuries accounted for about 51% and unintentional injuries accounted for 49% of all injuries. Homicides accounted for 91% of intentional injuries and 47% of all injury-related deaths. Firearms (23%) and road traffic crashes (22%) were the leading single causes of deaths due to injuries. About 15% of injuries were due to substance intoxication, particularly alcohol, which in this community comes from illicit brews and is at times contaminated with methanol.

Design: Prospective intervention study includes awareness campaigns, household visits for screening, and referral and treatment of people with hypertension. The primary outcome was overall change in mean systolic blood pressure (SBP), while secondary outcomes were changes in awareness of hypertension and other CVD risk factors.

Slum dwellers often see little of the 'urban advantage', suffering more from infectious diseases, increasing food costs, poor access to education and health care, inadequate water and sanitation, and informal employment. A recent Cochrane Review of the impact of slum upgrading strategies found a dearth of unbiased studies, making it difficult to draw firm conclusions. The Review calls for greater use of process data, and qualitative alongside quantitative methods of evaluation. India is a lower middle income nation with large gender disparities and around 65 million slum inhabitants. The Asha Community Health and Development Society, a non-governmental organisation based in Delhi, has delivered a multi-sectoral program across 71 slums since 1988. This article reports on a mixed-method study to document measureable health and social impacts, along with Asha's ethos and processes. Methods: Several observational visits were made to 12 Asha slums where informal discussions were had with staff and residents (n = 50). Asha data records were analysed for change over time (and differences with greater Delhi) in selected indicators (maternal-child health, education, child sex ratio) using descriptive statistics. 34 semi-structured individual/small group interviews and 14 focus group discussions were held with staff, residents, volunteers, elected officials, civil servants, bankers, diplomats, school principals, slumlords and loan recipients (n = 147). Results: Key indicators of health and social equity improved over time and compared favourably with those for greater Delhi. The Asha model emphasises rights, responsibilities, equity and non-violence. It employs strategies characterised by long-term involvement, systematic protocols and monitoring, development of civil society (especially women's and children's groups) to advocate for rights under the law, and links with foreign volunteers and fund-raisers. Stakeholders agreed that changes in community norms and living conditions were at least partly attributable to the Asha model. Conclusions: While lacking a control group or complete baseline data, evidence suggested substantial improvements in slum conditions and social equity. The Asha model offers some lessons for slum (and broader) development.","funding":"Australia India Institute; Nossal Institute for Global Health at the University of Melbourne","cited":22,"publisher":"BIOMED CENTRAL LTD","year":2016,"volume":"16","pages":11},{"authors":"Gonzaga, Elmo","title":"The Cinematographic Unconscious of Slum Voyeurism","source":"CINEMA JOURNAL","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"This article examines how films set in the informal settlements of the Global South are exhibited and awarded at international festivals because of their authentic evocation of third world reality.

While recent literature from Ghana has shown that municipal water rationing and lower socioeconomic status tend to drive sachet consumption at the metropolitan scale, some low-income communities with a reliable piped water supply still exhibit diverse drinking water-seeking behaviours. This paper explores the drinking water landscape of one poor, informal community in Ashaiman, Ghana, as a case study of the individual- and community-level factors that shape household drinking water decisions. Using the results of a water questionnaire completed by 95 households and the transcripts of four focus groups, our findings suggest that, after controlling for demographics, sachet water consumption is associated with proxies for higher disposable income and lack of knowledge about household water treatment methods, while social processes and attitudes toward water quality do not seem to drive drinking water decisions. This community presents a paradoxical drinking water landscape, as poverty abounds despite excellent piped water access, and low-income households with slightly greater means tend to opt for packaged water as opposed to being driven to it by piped water shortages. These nuances in drinking water purchasing behaviour can inform policy and planning for drinking water provision in urban slums across the region. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

DO. BOD. COD. detergent/surfactant, total conform, and Escherichia coll. In the upper part, there are 6 parameters below the quality standard, consisting of 4 physico-chemical parameters and 2 microbiological parameters. In the middle part, there are 8 parameters below the quality standard consisting of 6 physico-chemical parameters and 2 microbiological parameters. In the lower part, there are 6 parameters that exceeded the quality standard consisting of 4 physico-chemical parameters and 2 microbiological parameters. The seasonal difference of parameters averagely has shown that the water quality in the rainy season is better than in the dry season. However, on average, the water sampling taken before flowing to the village has a better quality than past the village.","cited":26,"publisher":"POLISH SOC ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING-PTIE","year":2021,"volume":"22","issue":"11","pages":11},{"authors":"Pearson, Jennifer; Robinson, Simon; Reitmaier, Thomas; Jones, Matt; Ahire, Shashank; Joshi, Anirudha; Sahoo, Deepak; Maravi, Nimish; Bhikne, Bhakti","title":"StreetWise: Smart Speakers vs Human Help in Public Slum Settings","source":"CHI 2019: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2019 CHI CONFERENCE ON HUMAN FACTORS IN COMPUTING SYSTEMS","language":"English","doc":"Proceedings Paper","abstract":"This paper explores the use of conversational speech question and answer systems in the challenging context of public spaces in slums.

Although emerging research has focused on how slum residence is linked to risky behavior, there is a paucity of work on how migration to slums is related to risky sex. Using a sample of sexually active women from the 2000 Nairobi Cross-Sectional Slum Survey (NCSS), this paper demonstrates that the relationship between slum residence and risky behavior is a multifaceted one. Beyond the effect of current residence in slums migratory factors, specifically previous place of residence and length of time since arrival, prove to be significant cofactors, with the effect of the former conditioned by the latter. Perhaps more importantly, where migrants moved from appears to influence risky behavior in a non-uniform manner. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

But as the CP model moved from wealthy societies to the Brazilian favela (urban slum), it faced far greater challenges. Tasked with displacing the deeply rooted authority of drug gangs, it sought to extend state authority territorially, as well as to curb criminal violence. Paradoxically, it succeeded at the latter without achieving the former. Drawing on evidence from the Rio de Janeiro's Pacifying Police Units and Bahia's Community Security Bases, this study asks how Brazil's CP programs achieved their goals of reducing violence without displacing criminal authority. I argue that a common interest among police and locally embedded drug gangs in limiting violence led to tacit arrangements between them to share authority as a condition of peace.

Understanding BoP patients' healthcare choices is vital to inform policymakers' effective resource allocation and improve population health and livelihood in these areas. This paper examines the factors affecting the choice of health care provider in low-income settings, specifically the urban slums in India. Method: A discrete choice experiment was carried out to elicit stated preferences of BoP populations. A total of 100 respondents were sampled using a multi-stage systemic random sampling of urban slums. Attributes were selected based on previous studies in developing countries, findings of a previous exploratory study in the study setting and qualitative interviews. Provider type and cost, distance to the facility, attitude of doctor and staff, appropriateness of care and familiarity with doctor were the attributes included in the study. A random effects logit regression was used to perform the analysis. Interaction effects were included to control for individual characteristics. Results: The relatively most valued attribute is appropriateness of care (beta=3.4213, p = 0.00), followed by familiarity with the doctor (beta=2.8497, p = 0.00) and attitude of the doctor and staff towards the patient (beta=1.8132, p = 0.00). As expected, respondents prefer shorter distance (beta=-0.0722, p = 0.00) but the relatively low importance of the attribute distance to the facility indicate that respondents are willing to travel longer if any of the other statistically significant attributes are present. Also, significant socioeconomic differences in preferences were observed, especially with regard to the type of provider. Conclusion: The analyses did not reveal universal preferences for a provider type, but overall the traditional provider type is not well accepted. It also became evident that respondents valued appropriateness of care above other attributes. Despite the study limitations, the results have broader policy implications in the context of Indian government's attempts to reduce high healthcare out-of-pocket expenditures and provide universal health coverage for its population. The government's attempt to emphasize the focus on traditional providers should be carefully reconsidered.","cited":44,"publisher":"BIOMED CENTRAL LTD","year":2018,"volume":"18","pages":11},{"authors":"Huda, Fauzia Akhter; Mahmood, Hassan Rushekh; Ahmmed, Faisal; Ahmed, Anisuddin; Hassan, Aniqa Tahmina; Panza, Alessio; Somrongthong, Ratana","title":"The Effect of a Club in Making Differences in Knowledge, Attitude, and Practices on Family Planning Among Married Adolescent Girls in Urban Slums in Bangladesh","source":"INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"Early marriage and childbearing have led to Bangladesh having the highest adolescent fertility rate in the Asia Pacific region.

The percentages of the targeted population using any modern method of contraception were significantly higher among respondents in the intervention areas than those in the control areas (72.6% versus 63.5%). The unmet need for FP was significantly lower among respondents in the intervention areas than that of the control areas (16.2% versus 20.7%). The MAG club was a well-received strategy to provide comprehensive information on FP, which in turn helped improve contraceptive method practices and reduced the unmet need for FP among married adolescent girls in urban slums in Bangladesh. The government could leverage its existing resources to expand the MAG Club model in rural parts of the country to achieve the targets outlined in its Adolescent Reproductive Health Strategy.","funding":"UKaid from the Department for International Development (DFID) [SR1111D-6]; Government of Bangladesh; Government of CanadaCGIAR; Government of Sweden; Government of UK","cited":15,"publisher":"MDPI","year":2019,"volume":"16","issue":"20","pages":12},{"authors":"Kendre, Vidyadevi; Davane, Milind; Kulkarni, Shyam; Hawanna, Shital; Saraf, Saurabh; Nagoba, Basavraj","title":"A Case of Tetanus from Urban Slum of Latur City","source":"JOURNAL OF KRISHNA INSTITUTE OF MEDICAL SCIENCES UNIVERSITY","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"Tetanus remains an important health problem, particularly in the developing world.

Slum residents, already grossly affected by chronic poverty, are highly vulnerable to different forms of shocks, including those arising from political instability. This study describes the food security situation among slum residents in Nairobi, with specific focus on vulnerability associated with the 2007/2008 postelection crisis in Kenya. The study from which the data is drawn was nested within the Nairobi Urban Health and Demographic Surveillance System (NUHDSS), which follows about 70,000 individuals from close to 30,000 households in two slums in Nairobi, Kenya. The study triangulates data from qualitative and quantitative sources. It uses qualitative data from 10 focus group discussions with community members and 12 key-informant interviews with community opinion leaders conducted in November 2010, and quantitative data involving about 3,000 households randomly sampled from the NUHDSS database in three rounds of data collection between March 2011 and January 2012. Food security was defined using the Household Food Insecurity Access Scale (HFIAS) criteria. The study found high prevalence of food insecurity; 85 % of the households were food insecure, with 50 % being severely food insecure. Factors associated with food security include level of income, source of livelihood, household size, dependence ratio; illness, perceived insecurity and slum of residence. The qualitative narratives highlighted household vulnerability to food insecurity as commonplace but critical during times of crisis. Respondents indicated that residents in the slums generally eat for bare survival, with little concern for quality. The narratives described heightened vulnerability during the 2007/2008 postelection violence in Kenya in the perception of slum residents. Prices of staple foods like maize flour doubled and simultaneously household purchasing power was eroded due to worsened unemployment situation. The use of negative coping strategies to address food insecurity such as reducing the number of meals, reducing food variety and quality, scavenging, and eating street foods was prevalent. In conclusion, this study describes the deeply intertwined nature of chronic poverty and acute crisis, and the subsequent high levels of food insecurity in urban slum settings. Households are extremely vulnerable to food insecurity; the situation worsening during periods of crisis in the perception of slum residents, engendering frequent use of negative coping strategies. Effective response to addressing vulnerability to household food insecurity among the urban poor should focus on both the underlying vulnerabilities of households due to chronic poverty and added impacts of acute crises.","funding":"US Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance (US-OFDA); Wellcome TrustWellcome TrustEuropean Commission [097146/Z/11/Z]; Bill and Melinda Gates FoundationBill & Melinda Gates Foundation [OPP1021893]; William and Flora Hewlett Foundation [2009-40510]; Swedish International Cooperation Agency (SIDA) [2011-001578]","cited":37,"publisher":"SPRINGER","year":2014,"volume":"91","issue":"6","pages":16},{"authors":"Ranjan, Din Prakash; Namita; Chaturvedi, R.

Income and consumption expenditure determines economic stability and social well-being of the households. Income is used as a display to measure economic deprivations of the households in India. So, both the income and consumption expenditure are used to measure the overall conditioning of the households. Here the question arises weather consumer behaviour is determined more by income or expenditure. Some policy makers and economists believe that poverty can't be displayed by current income and it is not a stable measure to provide an exact description of individuals well-being (Meyer and Sullivan in The American Economic Review, 2221-2241, 2008). Consumption expenditure is not determined by consumers current income, but the measures of consumers permanent income are representative by his/her ability to earn income over a longer time period and also Expectations of future earnings and wealth (Friedman in A theory of the consumption function: A study by the National Bureau of Economic Research. Princeton University Press 1957). and the income which Friedman talks about is the annual incomes of consumers expect to earn over the years. It has been observed that income and expenditure didn't remain similar among households. Income is concerned as a good indicator of well-being for various reasons which are Housing, Food, Child care, Health care and other necessities. In low income households there is a possibility of consumption without expenditure and earnings. Income and expenditure are the two key fundamentals by which people make the best efforts to live a good life. Everyone wants to have a handsome income to live in a comfortable way. This study examines the income and expenditure pattern of slums dwellers and their financial requirements among the key financial services (i.e. savings, credit, insurance, micro-leasing and pension schemes) of Lucknow city, Findings suggest that poor people can and do save, particularly when institutional barriers to saving are cut off. Institutional polices should target poor people on the bases of poverty so that poor can get an opportunity to promote their poverty into more sustainable and inclusive wealth endorsement policies that will assist them to create own pathways out of poverty.","cited":11,"publisher":"SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG","year":2018,"pages":18},{"authors":"Kamal, S.

Due to the rapid growth of urbanization activities, slum regions are the most evolving regions in South India whose locations are improper in official maps and statistics. Thus, automatic location identification of urban slums provides vital information for urban planners to formulate pro-poor policies and allocate resources properly. To detect the slums automatically from VHR satellite images, Multi Shape-Multi Size-Morphological Profile (MSh-MSi-MP) technique is proposed in this work. The development of this algorithm is motivated by modelling the urban slums using the conventional Morphological Profile (MP) which fails to model different structures in an image. On the other hand, the proposed MSh-MSi-MP is built by the sequence of morphological opening and closing profiles with different shapes and different sizes of structuring elements. Though MSh-MSi-MP yields high accuracy, some open areas in informal settlements and roofline structures of formal settlements are still classified as slums. To optimize these misclassification results, Morphological Spatial Pattern Analysis (MSPA) is used as a post-processing operation. The four different very high-resolution satellite images of Madurai city, South India acquired by WorldView-2 Sensor (1.84 m) proved the ability of the proposed approach to identify urban slums from other features by generating higher classification accuracy than any other methods.","cited":29,"publisher":"TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","year":2021,"volume":"42","issue":"1","pages":19},{"authors":"Sharma, Sandeep; Verma, Pramod B.; Viramgami, Ankit P.; Vala, Mayur C.; Lodhiya, Kaushik K.","title":"Analysis of Out-of-Pocket Expenditure in Utilization of Maternity Care Services in Urban Slums of Rajkot City, Gujarat","source":"INDIAN JOURNAL OF COMMUNITY MEDICINE","language":"English","doc":"Article","abstract":"Background: India contributes 20% global maternal deaths every year.
